# Mapping Ocean Stories Timeline

### Began with 2017 class *Mapping Ocean Stories* and 2020 class created the Mt. Desert Island Historical Fisheries Atlas.

### 1. Develop a coding scheme for spatial data mentioned in interviews
### 2. Build a hub site to host the Maine Historical Fisheries Atlas (*Work with Ben Meader Middlebury '10)
### 3. Use text analysis to support the spatial coding process

The database is designed to record spatial, categorical, observational, and temporal information about each activity.

# Spatial Data: Audio transcripts

 &lt;font size="6"&gt; "But we would go up and &lt;strong style="color:#FFA500;"&gt;fish the channels, which is on the other side of Long [Porcupine] and you could always fish all the way up to Bald Rock and then back to the [southern?]&lt;/strong&gt;. You could tow up and down through there and catch a couple of hundred an hour of shrimp on a good day, a couple hundred pounds an hour. So some of the best fishing Iâd ever seen was just on that side of that island, just like a whole bunch of boats going back and forth. And shrimp wereâit was a lot of shrimp." &lt;/font&gt;

# Future Work

### - Continue to develop data collection and text analysis processes
### - Understand spatial semantics in the marine environment
### - Share the Spatial Glossary and Data Query with others
### - Further develop the uncertainty quantification and spatial classification schemes
### - Explore the potential for Large Language Models

???
I used catch composition and machine learning to infer a fisher's target species and used generalized additive models to explore the factors influencing target species.

&lt;img src="images/cod-ted-ames.png" alt="Map of Cod Spawning Grounds on the Coast of Maine" width="1000" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???
In Maine we have a rich history of collecting and sharing local ecological knowledge. Ted Ames collected and analyzed stories from 61- to 94-year-old Maine fishermen to show where cod had historically spawned and been caught along the coast of Maine and used this in addition to catch records to study movements of Atlantic cod.

Spatial activities are categorized by coders by their domain, subdomain, and observation type to create a set of standardized observations that can be reliably compared later using queries, summaries, and other systematic methods (Figure 3).

The spatial information for each activity is then classified by the geomethod and type of spatial information conveyed (Figure 4).

- **Domain** Activity Classification (Fisheries,
Aquaculture, Recreation)
- **Subdomain** Subcategorization and specificity for
observations (e.g. by species for fishing)
