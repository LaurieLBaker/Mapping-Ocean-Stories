"1","Q:        [0:00] Great.  We like to start by asking, how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:05] My name’s Erin Adams.  I use she/her pronouns, and I am the co-founder and CEO of Ocean Farm Supply.  


Q:        [0:16] Tell me a little bit.  What does Ocean Farm Supply do?  What is the mission of the company? 


A:        [0:22] Yeah.  We're Maine-based here, and it really was born on an aquaculture farm, an oyster farm, in Freeport, and we developed, and we now sell a plastic-free home compostable mesh bag for shellfish harvest, and also have a line for produce harvest as well.  So, really, the mission is trying to divert and interrupt that single-use waste stream that is generated on shellfish farms.


Q:        [0:48] Wow. We're going to have a whole bunch of more questions to dig into that some more.  But to start with a little more, some background about you, what you were doing before you started this company, can you go all the way back and ask you to tell me where you were born?


A:        [1:02] I was born in Worcester, Massachusetts.


Q:        [1:05] What year was that? 


A:        [1:07] 1983.


Q:        [1:09] Can you tell me a little bit about what it's like to grow up there?  Is that where you spent your whole childhood?


A:        [1:14] Yeah, I grew up in Holden, Mass., a suburb of Worcester there.  Grew up on a cul-de-sac.  And a really, really nice childhood.  Yeah, just great.  I went to Wachusett High School.  My mom worked in the airlines.  Well, she was at home for a while while my brother – I have an older brother – we were growing up a little bit.  Then she went back to work, to work at the airport in Boston.  She was a flight attendant before we were born.  My dad's an electrician, so worked with his father.  That was a pretty standard New England grow-up time, a lot of riding bikes and woods, and all that.  


Q:        [2:00] You said you have an older brother.  What does he do? 


A:        [2:03] He works in software systems with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.  He spent most of his career at UMass Dartmouth doing a similar thing, working with IT.  This is his third year there at WHOI. But he mostly works from home in that capacity.  


Q:        [2:22] Do you have any history – it doesn't sound like your parents were employed this way, but any history of your parents or more extended family that have any history in the fishing or aquaculture sector for work?


A:        [2:32] Nothing that I knew about growing up.  On my mom's side, I've heard that my grandfather or someone on my mom's side was [a] merchant mariner or shipped out, but that wouldn't have been anything that I would have learned growing up.  It's just something that came to light as an adult after being on the water and being more on boats.  Yeah, so nothing tied to the water growing up.


Q:        [2:58] Or related, like fish processing, marketing, bait, gear?  None of the related industries either? 


A:        [3:05] No, no.


Q:        [3:07] Interesting.  You said a little bit about where you went to, I think, high school.  But can you describe your educational background and trajectory? 


A:        [3:15] Yeah.  So, I went to Wachusett High School.  I graduated there 2002, and then went – well, started at George Washington, did a year there, and then took a break.  Wasn't quite ready for college at that point.  So, took a break, lived abroad in Ireland for a year, got my head on straight a little bit of what I wanted to do.  Then, ended up at UMass Dartmouth in Massachusetts, in Southeastern Mass, really because of the interest – at that time, I did have an interest in marine science and marine biology.  It was just kind of a curiosity.  That was an option.  They had a major there.  Then, also, my brother was there too.  I think that I have to give that credit a little bit, even though, I think at the time, it was not conscious, a conscious decision there.  But I think that was definitely something that, after floating around a little bit, was a nice way to come home.  


So, I was at UMass and was doing biology track.  It was, again, just following a little bit of curiosity and an opportunity.  I was looking for a job my second year there.  It would have been 2006.  Is this 2006?  Yeah, 2006.  This guy that I was just studying chemistry with in a study group – I had just, off the cuff was like, “I'm just looking for a job.   Have you heard of anything?”  He was working in this fisheries lab and said that they were hiring.  I pursued that, interviewed, and got that job.  That was in Kevin Stokesbury’s lab at UMass with the School of Marine Science and Technology down there in New Bedford.  


The bread and butter of that lab is doing a video survey where we work cooperatively with fishermen, go out, and drop a video camera – at the time, it was four cameras and eight lights, and it was a live feed from a third wire.  We load all this up on boats and worked cooperatively with all the scallopers.  While the bulk of the job as a digitizer – was kind of the title – was working in the lab and going through the images that we would collect because we would go and we dropped this apparatus every three nautical miles for the whole entire continental – the fishing grounds on the western continental shelf here. 


That was a huge turning point or a way that – it was amazing – I was actually just talking to Kevin earlier today on a project that we might potentially be working on.  That was just pretty pivotal.  Looking back, when you look back at the arc of your life, I think that was a pretty pivotal decision and opportunity that I had there to do this work, work in this lab with those people, but then also work directly with the fishermen, go on the fishing boats and see how they were connected, the research that we were doing, how it was filling in and aiding in the stock assessment, and following that data all the way from collecting it to where it's being used, locked in, clicked – this is what I’d like to pursue, doing something like that.


Q:        [6:39] From there, you graduated?


A:        [6:41] Yes.


Q:        [6:44] Did you go into the industry?  How’d you get up to Maine? 


A:        [6:46] Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of a long – I can just go through it, I suppose.  A lot of different stepping stones.  So, graduated, worked with SMAST and Kevin until graduation, and then didn't want to go right into grad school with the fisheries lab there.  It’s an academic place, so it was an option to go right into if I wanted to, but I wanted to take some time.  I went out to Alaska to be an observer and worked with Alaskan Observers, Incorporated out there.  I went out, I think, it would have been in December 2007, and did training in Seattle.  Then, I remember flying out to Dutch Harbor on Christmas Eve.  It was a very sad Christmas because I was the only one in the bunkhouse there.  But then, yeah, joined a long line boat there the day after Christmas, and I observed for about a year and a half, did about four contracts.  


Then, for those who have observing experience, it was really – I think, again, working with fishermen, I learned that if you just work hard, that you're going to be respected, didn't really matter – because everyone on those boats are from all different backgrounds and different places.  It doesn't matter when you're out there.  You have to make work a little bit easier for the people that you're working with.  That was my biggest takeaway from that.  That chapter came to an end, wasn't interested in continuing that, and so was looking for other opportunities, and then, at that time, was ready to go back to school.  


So, ended up back at Kevin's lab doing a master's at SMAST.  It took me a while.  I was doing part-time master work and schoolwork, and then also working in the lab, doing similar stuff and some other video work with the yellowtail.  We did an open cod end camera survey that's still operational right now.  I finished up my master's in 2015.  Yeah.  


From there, didn't want to go right into a PhD, so it's very slow. (laughter) Always need breaks in between all the different transitions.  It was like, “OK, what do I want to do?”  So then, at that time, I had heard of Sea Education Association.  It's based out of Woods Hole.  “OK, this sounds great.  I want to get out.  I want to have a sail.  I want to teach.  I want to travel.”  And so was able to really volunteer with SEA just to start, and took some time, saved up a little bit.  Took some time to see where I wanted to go, and it worked out to become an assistant scientist with them.  I worked with them full-time for four years.  To really supplement that as well – because it's wonderful.  It didn't pay very well for what I needed.  So then, to keep that going, I fished in Alaska, in Bristol Bay salmon fishery on a gill netter up there.  


That's really, I think, the biggest one of – again, finding the Stokesbury lab and then finding SEA, I think those are what has curated or shaped my current – it's kind of funny seeing that thread.  But with SEA, a lot of my community is shipmates from SEA.  Two co-founders, business partners with Ocean Farm Supply, I met on SEA – Eric and Willy – Eric Oransky, Willy Leathers.  Really, that's when first started to understand the plastics in the water aspect because it’s something, too, when you're on the water sailing or on a boat, you don't see plastic in the water.  You'll see some big stuff every once in a while, but you don't see what they would think of as a garbage patch going through those waters or the different gyres.  But when you put a net through the water, then you're going to see all that stuff at a more micro scale, and actually counting it and collecting it.  


Being in really remote waters, going from – I remember we had student projects with SEA, and we went from New Zealand to Tahiti.  We went really remote waters.  We didn't go the straight route.  I think we found microplastics in eighty-something percent of our water samples.  That exposure is what made me – it really sunk in.  Then, coming back to Maine, or coming to Maine – what brought me here was I had a free place to stay in Freeport. (laughter) That was really the biggest – I think when I first started, people ask me – “Oh, yeah, I spent time in Maine.  I worked in shipyards in Belfast and Freeport.”  And then I was like, actually, what made it happen was because my best friend's parents had a house that they weren't currently occupying in Freeport, and so let me have that access.  


So, moved there in 2019.  I was done sailing, wanted to put down some roots, and wanted to explore a new area other than New Bedford, even though I love New Bedford.  Just one of those things – a new place.  So, didn't have a job coming to Maine.  Then, started to – fresh start – see what happens there.  Eric and Willy, who are my business partners, were living here already.  They already had Maine Ocean Farms, which is the oyster farm that they started in 2017.  2017?  2016?  There wasn’t really – I did go out on the farm with them.  They were, at this time, formulating the foundation of Ocean Farm Supply and looking into different things that they could use instead of plastic on their farm for harvest.  


Concurrently, while they were doing that, I was getting set up here in Maine, got a job at Patagonia, started teaching tissue biology at SMCC.  I worked with Net Your Problem, which is a fishing gear recycling company, and they're based – Nicole Baker – they're based mostly out in Seattle and Alaska. They just finished up a project right now in Bristol Bay, collecting gill nets, the nylon, all the mesh, which was a really cool – there was a great – we're connected through a network.  It was a really good way for me to get back working somewhere in fishing, in fisheries, in plastics, and trying to learn more about that.  


On the whole, I was hired as the New England representative/coordinator.  So, starting using pot warp and trying to find a way to take all of the old line and rope and repurpose, whether it's for artists – created a little rope depot in Freeport.  I remember going up to Stonington a lot to their rope pile and filling it up and just trying to figure out, what are the economics of how do we get this stuff out of – the end-of-life material.  How do we keep that in use in different ways or send it for recycling?  


So, did that for a couple years, and then the opportunity to – Eric and Willy approached me with Ocean Farm Supply to see if I would like to come work with them and build this business, and it aligned really well, and we align really well.  Yeah, they're just great to work with.  So, that's kind of the road.  


Q:        [14:31] What year did you join the company, or did the company form (inaudible)? 


A:        [14:35] Yeah, the company formed in late 2020, and I would have joined March 2021.  Eric and Willy had done the process of finding the manufacturer and working with them on a product that they were just making sure on their farm to see if it's something that would work on their farm.  So then they could put more effort into having that be a solution for other farms, too.  I think because of COVID, too, it delayed things in terms of – things took a lot longer to grow, but at the same time, it gave us the push of – the market for oysters dropped out.  So, the guys were like, “How do we adapt?  How do we diversify?  What are we looking for?  What auxiliary businesses can we do to support our industry?”  Especially since it's such an environmentally beneficial organism, let's take a step back and look at the big picture.  How do we make it even more environmentally beneficial or environmentally neutral?  That's where that thought process came from.  They were all on board as well, seeing the plastics research.  That’s what I think is a low-key influence for them.  Maybe “low key” is the wrong word – just a straight influence, yeah.


Q:        [15:55] Yeah.  Just going back to background just for a minute, and then we’ll circle back and have even more detailed questions about your role in the sector.  Are you married?  Do you have any children?


A:        [16:08] No, I'm single and no kids.  No pets. (laughter)


Q:        [16:11] You've told us a lot about your trajectory now, but just to ask another way, perhaps, how do you like to describe your role in the fishing and aquaculture industry in Maine? 


A:        [16:24] Yeah, I was thinking about that.  How do I describe my role?  Because I hold Ocean Farm Supply.  And then there's also – I’ve had the opportunity to become more involved in workforce development as well with – there's an apprenticeship program that GMRI and Maine Aquaculture Association received funding for.  This is their second year doing that.  I had the opportunity to work with them to run their initial boot camp in April.  I really enjoyed that.  I see myself not necessarily – I'm not on the farm at all this summer, actually.  What I would like to see myself continue to work in is in support and education and workforce development, looking towards the next steps in the future of aquaculture here in Maine.


Q:        [17:46] Great.  Do you also see it as the plastic-free gear alternative as well as part of –?  I mean, that's definitely part of what you currently do, but as part of how you see your future role.


A:        [17:55] Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  I think that's the backbone of it for holding these different interests that do connect.  I think having to be solutions – looking for solutions and keeping it people-focused as well as environmentally-focused, I think that’s the questions I ask myself.  That’s what drives me as well.  How can we create a solution that reduces the amount of plastic that we're just habitually reliant on?  Then, through that, that will hopefully help the environment, and then also, at the same time, as we grow as a sector, what does that look for?  I don't have the answers for that.  I think I just like being – I really enjoy being a part of this industry and wanting to support it as it grows as much as I can.  


So, trying to find those avenues, too, of – OK, so everyone who works in the water has – that’s the foundation.  That’s what we need.  That's what we're trying to support.  But there's all these other facets.  How do we keep all of that going?  Where can we make things easier?  So, I guess I don’t know if I have a succinct role that I could be like, “Oh, this is what I want to fill or what I feel like I fill.”  I just like being in the game. (laughter)


Q:        [19:34] It sounds like you have participated directly in commercial fishing in the past.  Do you currently hold any commercial fishing licenses or leases? 


A:        [19:42] No, I have a 100-ton captain's license and 200 near-coastal mate.  I work currently as well part-time as one of the captains for Lucky Catch, which is a lobster tour boat.  We go out.  We haul traps.  We have three boats.  Two of them commercial license, so I don't haul those traps, but we have a demonstration license that potentially I can haul those traps, just those catch and release.  Yeah, working on those vessels, and that's more of an educational – folks from out of town coming in, and we go fishing.  It's like a public charter, in a way.  We talk about the industry, and that's a great way – I've had a lot of good conversations about people asking about whales or windmills or just trying to really understand the industry more, which is really a great opportunity just to talk to a lot of different people from all over and also hear what people's perceptions are, and what questions they ask.


Q:        [20:49] I imagine, wow.  So, I have a series of questions.  You have a lot of different experiences over time.  I think we’ve captured a lot of that through the narrative of how you got here.  But I'm going to give you some specific prompts just to see do you have experience in this and go through a few.  Do you have any –?  Well, do you have any experience in bookkeeping, bait, or gear?


A:        [21:11] Gear through recycling.  Gear through I built nets in Alaska for gill nets for the salmon drift fishery – sockeye fishery.  Bait, no.  And the other one was –?


Q:        [21:31] Bookkeeping.


A:        [21:33] Bookkeeping with Ocean Farm Supply.


Q:        [21:35] Yeah, and Ocean Farm Supply on the gear development side.


A:        [21:39] Yes.  Yeah.


Q:        [21:41] Great.  And then, in terms of seafood, post-harvest processing, marketing, or trade?


A:        [21:47] No, maybe some promotional events, but nothing direct.


Q:        [21:56] In advocacy, education or community-based organizations related to fisheries?


A:        [22:02] Yeah, yeah.  When I was at SMAST, I was the community outreach coordinator, volunteer coordinator – something like that.  Then, education through the apprenticeship program with GMRI and Maine Aquaculture Association, working with them on their workforce development, and that's through SMCC as well.  I forgot to mention them.  I suppose Lucky Catch is also educational.  I do still teach at SMCC but in more of a general bio.  I don't really talk about fisheries stuff in my class.


Q:        [22:35] SMCC?  What’s the acronym?


A:        [22:38] Pardon me.  Southern, Maine Community College.


Q:        [22:42] I was guessing, but great to have on the record.  Do you have any experience in research and development side of the industry? 


A:        [22:50] Yeah.  So, research, working with SMAST, cooperative research with their scallop video survey and yellowtail and cod video survey down in New Bedford, and then doing oceanography field science through Sea Education Association, where we would do water quality, water parameters, (inaudible) for phytoplankton and zooplankton composition and temporal and spatial composition.  


Right now, currently working on a project with Hurricane Island with Ocean Farm Supply.  We received a grant, one of the SOAR grants, and it's using our mesh as a sacrificial sleeve around scallop lantern nets.  So, thinking about – there's a lot of stuff that's going to grow on a net that's in the water.  How do we mitigate that labor?  How do we basically either create less of that issue or make labor dealing with it less?  This is a two-year project.  We're about halfway through the first year.  We just completed our second trial, and so we have a number of treatments that we have out in the water for a month and we had for May, July – we’ll have another session in September, and then we'll do the same thing next year.  Yeah.  So, that's the current research right now.  


Q:        [24:18] So interesting.  Do you consider Ocean Farm Supply generally – I know it's a business, but do you consider it on the research and development side of gear alternatives?  I wonder.


A:        [24:27] Yeah, definitely.  I think coming at it from – my background’s in science and working on the water, so that's always going to be my bias, trying to bring as much into that as possible, and also just following where the interest is.  I should give credit to Dana Morse, who is with Sea Grant, for really planting the seed a couple of years ago, introducing this material, and talking to him about the ocean harvest bag, which is the mesh that we sell.  He was like, “Oh, this could be a really interesting application with scallop lantern nets.”  I want to make sure I give him credit for that because that was a seed planted.  He's such a connector and such a valuable asset to our industry.  Then, thankfully, the opportunity came for funding and for partners with Hurricane Island, and it's cool how that happens.


Q:        [25:18] I was going to ask that, thinking about – there's so much plastic in fishing. How did your company decide to focus on the mesh bag?


A:        [25:28] Yeah, so thinking about the single-use, I think that was something – we used floating bags on our farm, which is HDPE black plastic.  But that can be used year after year after year.  I think we're just maybe – we don't really retire that gear.  Every year, we're able to use it.  Line.  We use a lot of line.  So, that's something that could be a potential thing that we – I think we replace the most line and bungee and small twine.  I think that's stuff that we do replace as needed for maintenance throughout the season.  We're always checking for chafe and all of that.  


Really, for us, it was stark because we would harvest, and in the beginning, we were still a very small farm, but we would just deliver in the Portland area.  We would put stuff in a plastic bag and then deliver forty-five minutes later, and then two hours later, that bag might be thrown away or something like that.  That’s an extreme timeline, but not far off; within days, that bag is then – it was a very in-your-face thing for Eric and Willy to be like, “OK, we are just using this to throw away.”  


Then, both of them, but Eric, I think, was the one that initially found the manufacturer that we were able to partner with who were using this material, this cellulose material that's derived from European beechwood, and work with them and develop that relationship.  He's very tenacious in terms of when he has – the way his mind works is problem-solving and trying to figure out how can we make this work and really get into the details of things.  I think that was how it all really started – it was founded on here's a problem, and actually, we can figure out a way to make a solution that will work for us, and then, if it works for us, hopefully, be a solution for other people as well.


Q:        [27:40] Yeah.  So, the mesh bag is for delivery to the customer side (inaudible)?


A:        [27:44] Correct, yeah.  Harvest.  


Q:        [27:46] I don't know what they call that. (inaudible)


A:        [27:49] It’s just the polypro.  I call it onion bag.


Q:        [27:52] Yeah, exactly. (inaudible)


A:        [27:53] It’s just that onion/potato bag, whatever.  Yeah, I'm just using that instead.


Q:        [27:59] Great.  Then you guys are currently research and development of it as sort of a biofouling to absorb some of the biofouling for the scallop?


A:        [28:07] Yeah, for scallops.  We're not involved with this, but people have purchased it for using it for reefs, for reef restoration, finding it probably does break down a little bit too quickly for that.  People would like it to be in the water for a year or so when it does break down within two months in the water, which is great.  It's kind of what it's designed to be.  Also, thinking about what coatings.  I know you've talked to Katie Wheeler, and so working with her and her company, Viable Gear, on different coatings that still maintain the biodegradability and the environmental sensitivity to where we're putting it, but then actually prolong life. just trying to find those innovations.  


There's always, again, thinking about ways – we have a new weave of our material that's proving to be a bit stronger with larger quantities of oysters.  Of course, we started with oysters, which have the sharpest shell.  So, it's kind of like, oh, OK. (laughter) Then, thinking about, “OK, well, that's a good challenge.”  If it works for oysters, it's great.  Then, thinking about different weaves so that you can have it be a solution for larger quantities, for large-scale or long-scale shipping, stuff like that.


Q:        [29:22] I looked on your website.  Are you also looking at applications for terrestrial food, like farms?


A:        [29:30] Yeah, yeah.  Our manufacturer produces a produce mesh.  We have that available as well.  There's a large market for – large grocery stores use that, like Lidl and Aldi and Carrefour over in Europe, and also in New Zealand, like Countdown in New Zealand, and Costa Rica is a large market for them as well.  So, just trying to be like, “Hey, this is …”  There's no one yet using this in the States, and so there's a first mover advantage, and there's some – what I've learned is the industry has designed itself around plastic.  Plastic is great, right?  There's a reason why plastic is everywhere.  It is.  It's a great thing to work with and fairly cheap.  We've come to rely on it too much.  In produce packaging, or packaging in general, because of the heat-sealing capacity, you just melt plastic to each other.  All the machinery uses heat sealing, or a lot of it does.  This material, you can't heat seal it.  It has to be clipped or sewn or something like that.  This is a change.  It's a bigger change for some industries than just being like, “Hey, you can switch it out.”


Q:        [30:49] Do you feel like, I guess, at least in Maine, oyster farming is not such a long-running industry?  Do you feel like it's easier, potentially, to get people to adapt or pivot?  Because it's not like they've been doing it this way for 50 years here.


A:        [31:02] Yeah, for sure.  I think Maine is such a – the independence and the innovation that everyone needs to have here has helped with that as well.  It's just kind of built-in.  But, yeah, it's a young – there's a lot of young farmers.  A lot of those farmers are looking for our material for their farm, which is awesome and great.  It's also cool to talk to the folks that have been around for decades and have them try it out and switch.  I think it's been a great spot.  I think being in the industry as well, that's – most of our accounts are here in Maine, and I think that is a testament to the fact that we're like – it's our community, and that's our network, and it is who we are around.  I think that's been – it's just been a really warm welcome, and we've received great feedback.  It’s not all great feedback.  This is the ways we can improve, or this is how it worked for us.  How do you use this?  There's challenges in introducing a new product.  Thankfully, it's been a really safe and wonderful space in Maine, a kind space, too, to start this business and mentorship – for the business side of things, but it's been a really fun journey.


Q:        [32:33] That’s great.  Just to go back and finish the list of the different ways you are participating in the sector, do you have any background or work in hatcheries? 


A:        [32:44] No.  


Q:        [32:45] Then in terms of seafood on the food service, like food preparation, customer interface side?


A:        [32:50] I worked in restaurants, so I think, yeah, as a waitress.


Q:        [32:57] Then, just for me, I guess, to clarify, your partners own an oyster farm.  And a lot of the gear you all – the gear that Ocean Farm Supply has developed in partnership with the farm.  You have worked on the farm, or do you have a – what's your relationship to the farm?


A:        [33:14] Yeah.  So Eric Oransky and Willy Leathers.  They own Maine Ocean Farms, and they also own Ocean Farm Supply.  So, Maine Ocean Farms is the oyster farm in Freeport.  Ocean Farm Supply is the bag business, the mesh business, gear business.  I am one of the co-founders and CEO of Ocean Farm Supply and have integrated into that business.  I am an employee of Maine Ocean Farms.  I think my role is actually not really working in that role right now too much, but I'm also the scientist with Maine Ocean Farms.  So, developing a science plan there of what does that look like?  That's also what is helpful for farms.  What do we need to look out for? What questions?  We're kind of facing this right now, but what questions do we need to answer to have answers in place for as we grow, as climate changes, as water parameters change, as different viruses and bacteria come into our waters, all of this stuff?  I think I went on a tangent. (laughter) So, they own both.  We talk all the time about – it's one big thing, but that's the delineation.  


Q:        [34:49] Great.  Thank you.  That's helpful.  This is often a challenging question for folks who do this kind of work, but if you don't mind talking us through what does an average day of work look like for you in your roles?


A:        [34:59] Yeah.  I check email first thing.  I know I'm probably not supposed to do that, but I do.  I wake up, and I check email.  I have four different email accounts. (laughter) So, go through that, see if we have any orders for Ocean Farm Supply, double check if I have any meetings that day.  There’s summertime versus wintertime.  So, summertime, if I'm not on the water that day – being on the water right now is working with Lucky Catch.  Even so, this is still what will happen.  Check emails, see if we have any orders, any calls I have to make, any meetings, and then do what needs to happen.  


Right now, this time of year is pretty reactionary in terms of doing things that have been put in place in the wintertime.  So, I'm not doing a ton of – right now – looking for grants or writing or creating much, which is something that's always on the back of my mind.  I'm like, “OK, let's think about what do we have to do?”  Right now, where the business is, we're just putting everything back into the business right now.  As that grows, still need to continue to generate revenue in a different capacity, and so that's where that time – trying to maximize time and make sure that I can work a bunch in the summer so that in the winter, I can focus more on Ocean Farm Supply and other projects that aren't generating the revenue right now, or the income, I should say.  Not revenue as much as what I'm actually taking home.  Yeah.


Q:        [36:50] How do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing sector, including how others may perceive or treat you?  That could be about past roles as well as current roles if you have any different observations you want to make.


A:        [37:07] I was thinking about this because I've always been – coming at fishing, working in the fishing environment from the science point of view, versus going in as a commercial fisherman, I've always been the minority on the vessels that I've worked on, except for sailing.  SEA, primarily, there's more women or women-identifying, or queer.  More diversity there for SEA.  But for fishing, it's men and then just me.  Sometimes, I was just the only woman on a boat, and there’s, like, 50 guys.  


I have a hard time thinking about how me being a woman has – how my experience would be different if I was not a woman.  At the same time, thankfully, I’ve never been unsafe situation.  I've always felt respected or, at the very worst, ignored, which is fine.  I mean, there are definitely times you do get more attention.  In that environment, I didn't receive more attention identifying as a woman.  Would you repeat the question just to make sure I don't go off on it too –?


Q:        [38:53] Yeah.  How do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing sector, including how others perceive or treat you? 


A:        [39:09] Yeah, now I think, because of my experience, I have a lot of confidence in my experience working on the water, and I very much hold that capability as part of my identity.  I do think a lot about – or I can be very hard on myself with making mistakes.  Whether this is perceived or not I think, I feel like I don't have too much room for error.  Because right now I'm in a position where I do want to work on the water and work as a captain in a different capacity and grow up and continue to be a good boat driver.  That’s one of my goals is to be a really good boat driver.  There are more women voices on the radio and on the waterfront, which is great, but then I do worry about if I make a mistake and that opportunity is going to go away.  I'm sure men think this as well, so I'm curious.  I’m curious.  I don't know if they think that.  That's something that does cross my mind.  If I make a mistake, or when I make a mistake, then that's going to set me back, and I'm not going to get that opportunity.  Yeah.  There was once that I was – I docked the boat, and people clapped, and I did not like that. (laughter) It’s like, “OK, all right.”


Q:        [40:47] Indicates a low expectation.


A:        [40:48] Yeah.  Just like (inaudible).  Yeah.  It’s that mix of I don't want to look too much into it, but it does – I very rarely think, “Oh, I'm being treated differently because I'm a female.”


Q:        [41:03] You mentioned being the only woman on a boat with 50 men and also with a science background, too.  Obviously, that must have been a factor on some level.  Do you have any observations about what that experience was like?


A:        [41:20] Yeah.  This was up in Alaska.  I acted differently in that role.  I'm pretty friendly and outgoing, but I learned quite quickly that if I was just myself and friendly/outgoing, then things would get amplified, and some folks would think that I was flirting with them or engaging a little bit too much.  So, there was this friendliness, but also shell and this wall that I found that was helpful for me to have in those circumstances.  And also, dress.  I recognized that you are being watched.  You are looked at.  So, wore baggy clothes.  There was no reason to wear makeup and no makeup, or anything like that.  So, I downgraded, and I dimmed, for sure, in that to just focus on the work and take away standing out as much as other or a woman.


Q:        [42:45] What about compared to your experience (inaudible) capture fisheries in Alaska, but with aquaculture in Maine, if you feel like there are any differences in terms of how you present yourself or how you feel others are perceiving you?


A:        [42:59] Yeah, now I feel very confident and am very much OK and hoping – not looking poor, but hoping – very much being like, OK, I’m trying actively not to dim.  Thankfully, I work with men who – because I’m the only woman on the farm, but I work with men who amplify and are so supportive and so respectful and treat me as an equal.  I can feel myself – that's part of why I love working with them so much, is because they do create this environment that actually it’s not an issue that I'm a female at all.  Not that it was ever, but just having – it’s a really healthy work environment for me, and I think that's transferred to seeking out and hopefully holding different leadership roles, whether in workforce development with Ocean Farm Supply, working as a captain on a vessel.  I feel much more confident in taking up the space now, which is great.


Q:        [44:34] How does your role in the fishing sector work with any family or caregiving responsibilities you may have?


A:        [44:42] Right now, I have aging parents, so I think that's the – but at the same time, they're down in Massachusetts.  My responsibilities will increase in those scenarios.  But currently, no, I don't have really any caretaking of others that are day to day.


Q:        [45:13] Then, shifting now to observations you might have about environmental changes that impact your work.  Can you describe any changes in the marine environment you've noticed over your career working on the water, particularly here in Maine, but if you want to make any observations about your past work as well?


A:        [45:35] Yeah, I don't know if I could say I have enough experience.  I've been in Maine now, working on the water for about five years.  I think that's too short of a time for me to be like, “Oh yeah, this is what it used to be like, and this is what it's like now.”  I'm biased from what people tell me from working on the water, like the guys I work with.  I can't say anything from my own perspective on that for working in Maine in terms of how the water is changing or how the fisheries are changing.  I think more in a fisheries way of just how fisheries are changing from when I worked in fisheries science in New Bedford – so, this would have been like 2006 through 2015 – worked in New Bedford with scallopers.  


Then now, seeing a change in the stock in terms of – there is uncertainty of the number, how the resources are doing, and the shifting of species in different spaces, or recruitment, or where those boundaries – with crabs moving north, or crabs just being here, green crabs versus blue crabs, and black sea bass moving north, and then shell disease and lobsters and learning more about the egg viability within settlement changes with different circulation changes in the Gulf of Maine.  But a lot of that is from reading and talking to people versus actually seeing it with my own eyes.


Q:        [47:37] What about in terms of – I guess your business partners started their farm a few years earlier, it sounded like.  Maybe you haven't seen the year-to-year change, but in terms of having a relationship to that farm, have you heard them talk about any year-to-year variability or a trajectory or change over time that's impacted their work on the farm? 


A:        [47:58] Yeah, I think the thing that comes to mind first is in the wintertime – in Recompense Cove in South Freeport.  Eric, who grew up in Freeport, has mentioned that it has frozen over, and he has walked over to Bustins Island.  Now, yeah, it hasn't frozen in years.  What that looks like for the farm is that we do sink our gear, and we’re sinking later and raising earlier in the last few years because of worry of growth while the – we don't want to smother the oysters if it gets too warm and they want to start feeding.  That's something that we have – that is a change.  We are working, this past year – (inaudible) there's some other variables that influences, but we did harvest up until January, and then our last cage, we sunk.  We sink because oysters – we're able to harvest everything and sell everything of our market size every year.  Then, sinking oysters go dormant, so there's no growth in the wintertime.  Sinking also allows us to protect against any storms and then also gives everybody some time off.


Q:        [49:22] And the choice of when to sink and raise is based on the temperature.


A:        [49:25] Temperature.  


Q:        [29:26] This is also a response to the ocean temperature changes.  


A:        [29:29] Correct.  Yeah, yeah. 


Q:        [49:31] Do you guys have any sense of if it's leading to a faster-growing oyster because they're spending less time being dormant?


A:        [49:39] Yeah.  So, it depends.  There’s different variables that go into that growth.  But yes, you would think that one does lead to another.  The warmer the water, the faster the oyster is going to grow.  Yeah.  So, that's what they see down south.  They'll have yearly – oyster grows to market size in about a year.


Q:        [50:10] How long does it take you guys to (inaudible) oyster? 


A:        [50:12] Three years.  Yeah.


Q:        [50:15] You talked about the lack of sea ice and the temperature staying warmer later and then warming up earlier means you guys have altered when you lower and raise your cages and leaving them dormant for less time.  That's been one response or adaptation you guys have made.  What has made that possible for you to make that adaptation?  For example, are there any resources, relationships, knowledge, training, or organizations that you guys drew on in coming up with this response, or was it from something else?


A:        [50:46] Yeah, I think it's just noticing the water temperature.  The resources we have, I think, are really helpful on our farm in terms of – we have a boat with a hauler with a winch, and we have guys that have been with us for three years, and so have that knowledge, that institutional knowledge, and run the farm.  They're the ones that can be like, “Hey, OK, let's sink all the stuff.”  They actually create the plan.  So, having those folks on the water every day, and seeing that, I think that's been our best asset, and then also having the tools to put in to make that change quickly.  Like, “OK, all right, we'll start sinking things,” or “We'll sink things later,” or “We’ll hold these to harvest.  I think the nature of – that we have the flexibility in our own – I mean, I think any farm would also – the boat does help us a lot.  I think that's something that is pretty adaptable, depending on the timeline of the organism and how it's growing or not growing.  


We have started to collect more data and starting to develop more of a program, a scientific program for data that we collect.  We put in a grant for a sonde to collect temperature, salinity, pH – no pH – some other sensors in there, yeah.  Before that, we borrowed a sonde instrument from the Darling Center.  They let us borrow for a month just to see what it looked like, in terms of – they gave us a little training of zeroing out the instruments and calibrating the instruments, and then how to turn on and how to download and all that.  That's been really helpful.  


Then, Friends of Casco Bay have been people that we've met with as well.  They collect a lot of data in Casco Bay, and so making sure that anything that we collect on our farm, the data can be integrated into other databases, and so it can be used.  We're not really implementing too much there.  We have temperature loggers.  Evan, one of our guys, has been a huge driver in actually getting the stuff.  He comes from a marine science background and is on the farm every day, so can take salinity.  He’s been taking some water samples and looking under a scope for some phytoplankton and seeing the different chemical tracers and stuff.  It’s been cool.  It's been cool.  That data hasn't led us to make any changes other than setting ourselves up to be like, “What data do we need to help us in the future make changes?”  That is something that's very much on our mind.


Q:        [53:46] You mentioned sinking cages in the wintertime is obviously partially also to protect from winter storms.  I'm just curious.  I think you mentioned something like harvesting into January.  We had those winter storms this year.  I'm just curious if you guys experienced any impacts from those on the farm.  


A:        [54:01] Thankfully, no.  Yeah, that was fine.  That's great.


Q:        [54:10] Do you feel that in your work on the farm, as well as if it feels relevant to your gear work or other roles in the sector – do you feel like you are able to make the kinds of adaptations and changes you want, or are there sort of adaptations you wish you could make, but haven't been able to?


A:        [54:28] Yeah, I can't speak to say if there's been adaptations that we've – the specific adaptations that we want, but there are limitations within the regulations – with the state of Maine, when you get your site, you need to specify what gear you're going to use and the organisms you’re going to grow, and everything has to be kind of laid out.  That’s all part of that.  Any changes to that is extremely difficult.  The adaptations that we might – if we did want to use bottom gear or similar to (inaudible) gear, in the current system, we would not be able to.  I’d have to make an amendment.  I’m not actually sure what exactly would need to happen.  That is a challenge.  If we wanted to bring in other species, I think we do have – I think it's advantageous, and we did list a number of species that we could maybe grow on our farm just in case we wanted to.  That comes to the case for new farmers, making sure that you add that flexibility into your lease as it allows so that you can adapt.


Q:        [55:47] You did also make a brief mention of green crabs and blue crabs, neither of which are native to this particular part of the country.  Do you see any impacts of those on the farm, or is it just something you've heard about in our observations that they're around?


A:        [56:05] Yeah, for us, because we use floating bags – during the season, no.  We see a lot of green crabs.  This is, again, something for the guys that are on the farm every day.  But when we're raising the cages, there's thousands, thousands of green crabs that come up over the course that.


Q:        [56:25] On the cage or in the cage?


A:        [56:27] Yeah, it's in the cage in a way.  It's all in there.  If you think of it, it's like lobster trap material.  It has six slots that we take the floating bags – the floats off of them, and we can slide them in.  Then, it’s like this little motel, and then we have a little – it's on a little stand.  It’s like this big cage kind of thing.  There's a lot of different levels that the green crabs can all be within.  We see a lot of those.  We don't see mortality at a certain size.  We do worry about smaller oysters with the green crabs, but we don't worry – we haven't seen mortality at a larger size, significant mortality, that we've pinpointed to the green crabs.


Q:        [57:10] And then a big-picture question.  What is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future of Maine's coastal fisheries and aquaculture industries?


A:        [57:20] Yeah, for fisheries, I think we're so vulnerable.  The lobster fishery is so vulnerable.  All of these industries, it's a single species that people specialize in, whether it's lobster, the Eastern oyster, mussels, clams – I think we've been – you have to specialize.  You have to focus.  For financial reasons, for regulation reasons, it's efficient.  You have to make that decision for the most part.  But lobsters?  Our circulation is changing.  The larval settlement is going to change.  What does that mean for the inshore fishery?  Offshore fishery?  What are the implications of offshore wind, which is going to come.  That's what happens to our working waterfront there.  How do we protect the infrastructure there?  


I think all of that – I think that's one huge thing that impacts everything, is making sure that we keep the docks, we keep the access to ice, increase the access to ice, increase all the infrastructure there, or make it more efficient, something that, as the fishery changes, we can make those adaptations, which I don't necessarily know – I think some entities are looking into that.  But it's like, how quickly can we adapt?  How proactive can we be?  It's a really hard thing for humans, I think, societies to be really proactive in these things in these kinds of circumstances.  


For aquaculture, yeah, I think it's similar.  I think there's vulnerability in it being single species.  I worry about – I know the state are making moves for this, but as we grow, making sure we have enough seed capacity for that and redundancy in that so that if we have a seed failure, that trickles down to all the farms.  Workforce development in terms of keeping all this skill on the water.  If that means shifting from lobstering to – what Atlantic Sea Farms does is phenomenal in terms of having people grow kelp.  Does that mean having people start working for the wind farm?  It's a scary thing for me to say (laughter), whatever people's thoughts are there.  But yeah, servicing the wind farm.  I know there's other projects in the water – having people that know how to safely work on boats who have the vessels.  How do we keep them in the water?  What does that do for our culture?  


Yeah.  There's a lot of unknowns.  I know there are a lot of good people working on the road map going forward, but I think that's what I think about.  What options?  How can we communicate options to people so, as something shifts, they don't feel helpless, and they can have something to work towards and work with to maintain their identity, even if it has to shift a little bit?  What does that mean?  What are the core values?  How do we keep our waterfront working and keep the fishery – keep the animals and the organisms healthy so that we can continue to harvest them?


Q:        [1:01:33] As a follow-up to that, if you could tell policymakers in Maine what the biggest priority should be to help people adapt to these changes that you're describing, what would you tell them?


A:        [1:01:45] Again, I’m going to take this – I guess this is my perspective.  I feel a little bit removed from the farming situation right now.  Yeah.  I think it’s continuing to invest in leasing and in the permitting infrastructure, in the site selection, in actually really supporting and continuing to support – because there's a lot of support, and they're in there hiring people, and this is something that they know as well.  They just hired a pathologist, so we can maybe bring in seed from other states or just really putting an investment into what needs to be invested in, in terms of permitting and the science to be like, “OK, where are we vulnerable to viruses?” – to run different scenarios.  If this outbreak happens, what are the steps that need to be in place?  How do we know that we can then serve our shellfish safely again?  What needs to happen there?  I think that's something that's going to keep the economics running is actually just keep people working.  What do we need to do to keep people working?


Q:        [1:03:22] Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation trainings or programs for the fishing industry? 


A:        [1:03:27] No.  


Q:        [1:03:30] What strategies do you think would be effective in building resilience against climate-related impacts on fisheries and aquaculture? 


A:        [1:03:36] Would you repeat that one for me again?


Q:        [1:03:38] What strategies, training, or resources do you think would be effective in helping people adapt to climate-related impacts and fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [1:03:49] So, climate-related impacts and fishing.  What was the last part?  Culture?


Q:        [1:03:56] Aquaculture.


A:        [1:03:59] Aquaculture, pardon me.  So, what strategies?  I think continued preparation and develop more work – put things in place for workforce development, for contingency plans of if this happens, what can we do?  What will happen now?  If something happens, and all of a sudden, we can't lobster anymore, what happens to the 4500 commercial fishermen?  What happens?  And all the trickle-down there.  This is probably out there.  I’m not sure the full literature of all things.  Yeah, contingency plans, educational programs, going to where people are, and keeping people empowered through the integration of those resources and making sure that people can understand – yeah, have it be accessible.  


I mean, these aren't really strategy – I don’t know.  These are more like this would be good whatever strategy is decided upon.  So, training opportunities, communication, understanding of how do we reach those that need to be reached to prepare for the changes that will happen?  Changes are going to happen.  Then, offering tools and agency, I think, especially in Maine.  People want agency and information.  So, it's like a hub.  I don’t know.  I think (inaudible) more conversation. 


Q:        [1:06:35] Great.  Thank you.  Are there any other types of changes – so maybe not environmental or not the ones you mentioned so far – that are impacting your work, either on the farm or with the gear work that you'd like to tell us about? 


A:        [1:06:46] Any other changes, not necessarily environmental?


Q:        [1:06:48] Yeah.  Not necessarily environmental.  It could be social, economic, or just other tech-related ones.  


A:        [1:06:55] Oh, yeah.  I’m blanking.  I talked about us wanting to learn more about our own environment so that we understand changes that are in there for us to then adapt as but that's climate.  We're impacted by regulation.  The Vibrio stuff didn't impact us.  We've been icing for many seasons already.  So, I think that's – yeah, I'm so sorry.  I'm not really thinking of anything specific.  


Q:        [1:07:41] That’s OK.  None is a great answer.  


A:        [1:07:42] OK. (laughter)


Q:        [1:07:45] Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes you've experienced or noticed in the industry during your time?  This could include going back from earlier work in Massachusetts and Alaska.  You have this longer perspective.  Are there any – we've been talking about a lot of changes, perhaps, many of which are negative.  Are there any positive changes you've noticed?  


A:        [1:08:08] Yeah.  Speaking to what I'd like to see more of in terms of workforce development, I find that personally, there's been a lot of opportunity for me with being on the water, working on the water, hearing more female voices on the radio doing security calls.  I'm in Portland Harbor, so that’s potentially – that's where we are versus other ports.  And seeing more – having some really good conversations and questions from folks that come out and giving them access to the water – that's a positive.  The training that Maine is doing in terms of apprenticeship programs.  I first got into – gosh, I should have mentioned this.  I first got into aquaculture through the Shared Waters program.  


In addition to knowing Eric and Willy, we weren't really working together at that time, but it was the Shared Waters program.  When I first moved to Maine in the winter of 2020, right before and right at the beginning of COVID, we were meeting at CEI in Brunswick and met a lot of the players that are currently on the water now. That was a really significant and great opportunity that I was able to receive.  It was free, yeah.  It was just Tuesday nights, and you just drive.  I was living in Freeport at the time.  You just drive over, and then it turned to Zoom, which got messy because we weren't quite good at Zoom at that point in the beginning of the pandemic.  That was a great access.  


Then, thinking about business opportunities in terms of Ocean Farm Supply, which has helped us with our research development – so, mentorship programs.  We've been a part of the Dirigo Labs Accelerator, Top Gun, FoodTech, which is through the Maine Center of Entrepreneurs.  We have been a part of the inclusion in the blue economy offering.  We had a desk at the New England Ocean Cluster for six months through that, and that connection has been wonderful.  It’s one of those – the environment that I find myself in – that we find ourselves in – the company and the farm and everything – has been really positive.  


I think that there is – even though you can say – of course, you’re always going to want more money and more resources in your industry to help it meet its full potential in a faster way and effective way.  But I think that there has been a lot – there is a lot of opportunity in Maine in aquaculture and in business, and we've really benefited from that.  I personally have benefited from that.  I've learned a lot and have been paired with mentors that I know now – even if I don't know the answer, I know who I can go ask.


Q:        [1:11:29] You touched on this with hearing more women's voices on the radio.  But as a follow-up, have you noticed changes in women's presence, participation, or status in fisheries or aquaculture over time?


A:        [1:11:40] I think, yeah.  I’ve been in aquaculture for five years. I think there's always been a female presence.  There are women-owned farms – women-run farms.  I think Lady Shuckers does a great job of amplifying those farms.  That's Casco Bay.  And then you have Abby Barrows – Have you talked to Abby Barrows?  Yeah, great – up in Deer Isle and Bar Harbor – Bar Harbor Blondes.  What’s her name?


Q:        [1:12:22] Joanna.


A:        [1:12:23] Joanna.  Yeah.


Q:        [1:12:24] We talked to her, too.


A:        [1:12:25] Yeah.  So, I think aquaculture – relative to fisheries, I think there's many more women than men in New England anyway.  Many more women.  Let me rephrase that.  There's a larger female presence in aquaculture, in my experience than from what I experienced in fishing.


Q:        [1:12:54] Great.  What is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's coastal fisheries and aquaculture? 


A:        [1:13:13] My hopeful vision.  Ideally, we don't experience the climate impact that seems to be coming our way from changing waters, that societally we're kind of able to make the changes needed so that we can continue to have a robust lobster – we didn't even talk really about finfish or groundfish fishery.  I think for aquaculture – I don't know what this will look like but expanding the aquaculture – Maine has such a premium product, and the waters here are just so nutrient-rich.  From the bottom up, that’s what makes it so beautiful and all of our food so delicious, all of our seafood so delicious, is because we have that primary productivity.  So, protecting that so that we can continue to have a robust shellfish industry.  


Then just creating more farms that create that Maine brand of shellfish that folks can still work on the water, have that agency, do what they want to do, but then are supported through the state, supported through the public, to still keep that access there, the premium quality there, and then just continue to grow and have the best oysters in the world.  Nothing big. (laughter) Also, lead the innovations for – continue to lead innovations, thinking more about gear and processes – within that structure, within that support, having new processes, new gear, that reduces our reliance on plastic, creates robust local logistics and logistics for food safety and food transportation.  I think there's a lot – I think that's where we actually have a lot of power in Maine is having that innovation.  I think there's a lot of support there.


Q:        [1:16:19] Yeah, I was going to ask, actually – we've spoken to quite a few people that are involved in alternative gear, either on the development or the experimentation/implementation side.  I just don't have a sense in terms of the whole country – there's oyster farming happening in a lot of places.  Is Maine a concentrated place where this research development and product development and companies are happening, or it's happening everywhere?  It’s happening on the West Coast.  It’s happening in the South in terms of plastic-free gear. 


A:        [1:16:47] Yeah, I'm super biased, but I think for plastic free stuff, I think we're really on the forefront here.  We got Abby.  We have Ocean Farm Supply.  You have Katie.  There are folks doing seaweed cellulose for other cutlery and stuff.  I have to say I'm super biased because I'm here in Maine, I'm in this environment, I've been in the rooms with these people.  So, that seems like what I've experienced.  We were the first state in the country to pass the Extended Producer Responsibility law.  We're getting that going.  Abby's definitely on the forefront.  Sue Van Hook – she’s in New York, but she's doing the Myco Bouys.  That's a huge asset to us.  You have Adam on North Haven with North Haven Oysters, who are doing plastic-free gear.  I've heard of people (in pass?) working on things in the West Coast, but nothing really stuck because it's a passion, and it does take that R and D and the trial and error.  So, yeah, Maine’s on the forefront.


Q:        [1:18:11] Is there anything else you wanted to share with us in this interview? 


A:        [1:18:16] I don't think so.  I don't really know what I said. (laughter) I said a lot of things.  Yeah, no, thanks.


Q:        [1:18:23] Great.  


A:        [1:18:25] Thanks, guys.  I talked way too much.


END OF FILE"
"2","Q:        [0:00] So if we could just start with how you like to introduce yourself.


A:        [0:06] Hmm.  It sort of depends on who the audience is.  But my name is Abigail Barrows, and I am a marine research scientist and oyster and kelp farmer.


Q:        [0:16] And can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:19] I grew up right here in Stonington, Maine.


Q:        [0:23] And can you describe that a little for me?


A:        [0:25] Well, Deer Isle is an island off the coast of Maine.  It's pretty rural.  The ocean is a really big part of most people's lives here and is definitely a part of mine.  I didn't grow up working in the working waterfront.  My parents were transplants here.  But my mom had a deep love for the ocean, and I took that from her.  I spent a lot of time on the water, mostly just mucking around on sailboats and canoes and other watercraft and a lot of time swimming, and that sort of blossomed into my love for marine biology.  And I'm now a diver, and I surf, and I spend as much time in or on the water as possible.


Q:        [1:07] Great.  And you mentioned this just briefly, but where are your parents from, and what did they do?


A:        [1:11] My parents – my dad was from Connecticut, and he moved here in ’68 or ’69 as a 21- or 22-year-old and bought the local newspaper, which is still running to this day as editor/publisher.  And my mom moved here in the early ’70s as a nurse practitioner, and she worked in the health industry as a nurse practitioner both locally and up in Bangor for the majority of her life.


Q:        [1:43] Do you have any siblings?


A:        [1:45] I have three siblings.  I have two sisters and a brother.


Q:        [1:48] And are they in the area?


A:        [1:50] No.  They were all in the area, but now they're pretty dispersed.  One sister lives in Alaska with her three kids and husband.  One sister lives in Scotland with her Scottish husband and their child.  And my brother lives up in Canada, up in Quebec, and has two kids, but he comes down and I see him the most frequently.


Q:        [2:13] Do you have any family history of fishing?  You’ve mentioned briefly no, but I just wanted to – like beyond your parents.


A:        [2:20] Not that I know of.  I don't have family history in the fisheries that I'm aware of.


Q:        [2:31] And I'm guessing the answer to this, but I'm going to ask it anyway.  Do you have any history of your family working in other roles in the fishing industry, such as bookkeeping, processing, marketing, bait, gear?


A:        [2:44] No, other than I think my dad kept the local sardine cannery in good business when he was in his early 20s. (laughter) I don't think that any relatives that I know of closely have been involved in the fisheries.


Q:        [2:59] Are you married?


A:        [3:00] I am.


Q:        [3:02] And do you have any children?


A:        [3:04] Just the one.


Q:        [3:05] And how old is – 


A:        [3:06] Io (sp?).  She is five years old.


Q:        [3:09] And would you want your children to go into fishing or a marine-related industry?


A:        [3:15] I haven't really thought about that.  But she has been out on the boat with me since she was born.


Q:        [3:22] Awesome.  Well, we're going to transition into sort of your role in the sector.  How would you describe your role in the fishing or aquaculture industry in Maine?


A:        [3:33] Describe my role?  I guess I am a member of the aquaculture industry, oyster and kelp farmer, small business, owner-operated – pretty small role, but with the hopes to help people rethink how we could cultivate oysters and kelp not using plastic.  So I'm hoping that even though my farm is really small, that some of the work that we're doing there will have a much larger impact on the industry in the Gulf of Maine and further afield.


Q:        [4:09] Can you describe your farm a little for me?


A:        [4:12] Yeah, so Long Cove.  So the name of my company is Deer Isle Oyster Co., or Deer Isle Oyster Company, and we are situated in Long Cove, which is in Deer Isle.  And Long Cove is actually a really unique body of water.  It's long, as the name indicates, but about half of it drains out totally to clam flats at low water.  But there's also a deep hole – 120-foot-deep hole just a few hundred meters off the edge of my farm.  And the tide comes in and out of this very narrow channel and it creates a really strong current.  So every tidal cycle, it pulls in this really cold sort of open ocean rich[a] water and then really bakes on the flats coming in and out.


        So we have a diversity of species in there.  There's short and long-nosed sturgeon, I believe.  There's lots of pogies and herring that come in and a variety of wading and shore birds that call Long Cove their home for at least some of the season.  And historically there's been a lot of fisheries in Long Cove between soft-shell clamming and I think dragging back in the day for scallops.  There's elvers that come in the freshwater systems there, a lot of pogie seining and things like that – and a lot of lobstering around Deep Hole.  So it has a pretty interesting history.


        The farm that I am currently cultivating oysters and kelp on was established in 2001 or 2002 by a fellow named Danny Weed.  It was sort of before aquaculture was really taking off further than Damascotta.  He set up a three-acre lease and he farmed that for about just over a decade, and he sold a portion of it to some shellfish dealers here on the island, Ginny and Blaine Olsen.  They run a clam shucking facility down in Oceanville.  They're also lobstermen.  And they farmed it for a few years and realized they weren't really farmers.  They're more just wild harvesters.  So I purchased it from Ginny.  And I didn't know what the hell I was doing, (laughter) figured it out slowly.  And then two years ago, I purchased the remaining section of the lease from Danny, the original fellow.


        Yeah, so it's about three acres that are under pretty much full cultivation at this point.  I'm growing sugar kelp out there as my winter crop.  And in the next few weeks, we'll raise our Crassostrea virginica, our eastern oyster that we grow using surface culture.


Q:        [6:58] Great.  And can you describe the seasonal cycle of the farm for me a little bit?


A:        [7:04] In terms of – like there's so many aspects.  What – 


Q:        [7:10] I don't know.  I guess sort of the focus on different species, but also anything else you might be inclined to share.


A:        [7:18] Yeah.  When I first got into it, I'm like, oh, this is great.  It'll just be like a few months of work in the summer.  It's a full – more than a full-time job year-round.  And that's, I think, just the reality of small business, but also farming.  So the seasonal cycle is – for oysters, we raise the farm.  That is a shifting date with climate change.  Now that we're like really living with climate change here in the Gulf of Maine, that date has been creeping earlier and earlier each year.  I think we'll probably raise the farm the earliest that we ever have this year.  So we raise the farm.  And when I say raise the farm, that means back-breaking work that takes multiple tides.  We go out there with a boat and gaff onto some of the buoys we have out there, and we have cinder blocks tied every couple bags on the line.  So we're pulling up hundreds of pounds that are all like stuck in the mud, untying those, and trying to do it at low water so you're not pulling it through extra feet of water column, and fill the boat with cinder blocks and go drop them off and then repeat until we're done.  We do that in April, May each year.


        And then once the farm's up – all those bags have been sort of overfilled, because we want to reduce – contract the farm in the winter.  So as quickly as possible, we have to spread those three bags that are in one bag back into three bags so the oysters can thrive.  That really kicks off our spring – just getting everything organized and ready for starting our weekly harvesting for wholesale and retail and events.


        So all summer, we're cranking along pretty hard out there, and then we basically have to make all our money in three months.  That's kind of the season – a little less than three months.  So we push it really hard.  It's sort of a sprint-like pace, but at a marathon length.


        And in the fall, things start to slow down in terms of sales, but the work on the farm is still cranking, because the water end of August, early September is the warmest the water is, which means everything's getting biofouled.  Everything's growing really rapidly.  So a ton of work out there – lots of tumbling, lots of flipping a bag, lots of sorting, lots of repairs. You know, it’s the marine environment.  Something's usually going wrong that will steal your attention when you're like, oh, I thought we had a such a straightforward day.


        Oh, and I also didn't mention that in the early spring or early summer, we receive our oyster seed, so we receive hundreds of thousands of baby oyster spat, which just looks like tiny little baby oysters about the size of quinoa.  And we put those out and try to take as best care of them as we can and upgrade them throughout the season into larger and larger mesh sized bags, because the saying is more flow, more grow, more dough.  So we're always trying to get get more water flow in the oyster bags.


        And then in the fall we start thinking about winter and that balance of not tumbling the oysters too much, making sure that they have enough time to grow and repair and get nice and fat so they can hibernate once that water temperature drops.  And this past year, we sunk the farm a little bit later.  We aim for doing it around Thanksgiving, but I think we did it early December this year.  Again, climate change, water temperatures, all those sort of annual dates seem a little bit more diffuse and unpredictable – so really just having to pay attention to the weather, rather than being like, this is how we did it last year.  It's like, oh, this is totally different from last year.


        So we sink the farm, and then we then we seeded the farm with 2,000 feet of kelp – sugar kelp, Saccharina latissima.  And sugar kelp is a pretty different farming interaction.  You kind of set it out there and then go out and check on it a couple times a month.


        It's been a little bit – not a disaster this year, but there's a lot to learn.  I've learned a lot.  This is only our second year doing kelp and our first year really doing it on this scale.  And there's already – like 90% of what I have done out there I need to change for next year.  I was out there this morning.  Things are growing, but there was a lot of crazy storms this year, a lot of movement, a lot of infrastructure things that I need to change to be able to have a good, robust spring harvest and make it worth our while.


        Kelp is a spring harvest, and we'll be – I went out and measured it and checked the water temperature.  And again, that's where climate change and farming intersect directly.  We will just keep watching those water temperatures.  And looking at the growth, there's a bump that happens at the very end of the season that you don't want to harvest before, but you don't want to harvest too long after, because the water temperature then is warm, and stuff starts to grow on the seaweed and decreases value.  So it's a little bit of a dance.  And of course, the weather never cooperates, so it's going to be blowing 35 when you want to harvest.  So yeah, diversified into kelp, and that's part of our seasonal routine now.  We're still seeing how that feels and how that works, especially with the need to raise the oysters that are underneath the kelp.


Q:        [12:52] Great, thank you.  I'm going to return to some of the environmental stuff later.  But I'm curious – like what drew you to this work?


A:        [12:59] The love for pain and hardship and being broke.  No.  What drew me to this work?  So I bought the farm in 2015.  And I'd never been on an oyster farm, which is kind of ridiculous in hindsight.  I was doing a ton of research and lab work and had – previous to 2015, my job had sort of been more water-based in the summer, doing water quality monitoring and things like that and expeditions, and then more computer-focused in the winter.


        But once I was running and managing this global microplastics research project and running a lab down in Stonington, my job really became hyper-focused on the chair, sitting on my computer or sitting at the microscope.  I'm like, whoa, this is a means to an end right now with this project, but this is not how I want to be living my life.  So I saw it as an opportunity to hit a bunch of bases for me personally and for the community.  The ability to be outside and to be doing something physical, also the challenge of small business and to be my own boss – those were all very attractive.


        Also, I've been in the water quality sector and doing research and just learning more and more about the peril of wild-caught fisheries and how the Gulf of Maine is changing, and also I just kept on learning more about oysters, and I'm like, this really seems like one of the most sustainable fisheries out there.  And the writing on the wall is here.  Like things are changing in the Gulf of Maine.  What does Stonington look like without its working waterfront?  It's a pretty grim outlook.  So part of me was like, well, if I can get into oyster farming and show that this is like a really viable business, then perhaps some of the lobstermen would supplement their income or diversify into some form of shellfish or sea vegetable aquaculture, and that would help maintain sort of the salty foundation of our community – which I think was a little idealistic, but I was in my early 30s.


        But I think there is a grain of truth in that.  Like things are really shifting here, and I think that people are seeing like, oh, there's a demand for oysters.  There's a market for oysters.  You know, the lobstermen have such deep multigenerational knowledge of the waters around here.  So being able to apply that and still use the infrastructure that's set up for lobstering for aquaculture doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility.


        The other thing is realizing that even though we live in Deer Isle, the access to local seafood is kind of difficult.  It's better than it used to be, but it's still harder than it should be to get locally produced or caught seafood.  So that was sort of the third prong.


        So to summarize, running my own business – the attraction was to run my own business and to be outside and work in the water and have that never-ending challenge, and also to model what sustainable fisheries could look like, and then also to help preserve or maintain some level of our community and the working waterfront which defines it, and then also access to locally harvested sustainable seafood.


Q:        [16:39] Great, thank you.


A:        [16:41] That was long-winded.


Q:        [16:42] No, it was awesome.  Which commercial licenses do you hold?


A:        [16:45] Well, the DMR is ever-shifting, but I have my harvester license, which you have to have to harvest the shellfish that you buy and cultivate on your own lease.  And now they have an aquaculture license.  I also have that.  And I also have a dealer license.


Q:        [17:03] Can you talk a little bit more about the dealer side of things?


A:        [17:08] Yeah.  So for me, again, the DMR is really – the licensing and the aquaculture division has gone through a lot of changes in the last handful of years, and I think there's still a little bit of an identity crisis happening there, but there's been some much stronger leadership changes that now I think things are headed in the right direction.  But the dealer license allows me to drive my oysters places and shuck them and sell them to a variety of different customers.  With a harvester license, up until a month ago, that would allow you to sell direct out of your house.  They've now made that obsolete from June 1st through August 31st, which is the time when a harvester would make money selling oysters out of their house, because of the Vibrio pathogen.  So rather than risk any further public health issues, they did a blanket rule change for Maine which is actually dramatically and drastically going to impact small farmers up and down the coast.


Q:        [18:17] Yeah, I definitely want to return to that change.  But just before we get back to that, do you own your own boat?


A:        [18:26] Yeah, multiple.  And they're all work boats. (laughter) Yeah, they're functional and not pretty.


Q:        [18:37] And do you have any experience in the industry beyond just fishing or harvesting itself?  You talked a little bit about marketing and getting stuff out there I think already, but specifically the follow-ups for this are in bookkeeping, bait, or gear preparation.


A:        [18:52] Hmm.  I worked on the back of a lobster boat for some seasons, so I did a little gear work with that.  But no, prior to buying the oyster farm, I had zero business background, had never taken a business course in my life, and definitely did not have any sort of robust accounting system for myself.  No, there's been a steep learning curve.


        And I didn't have any money or credit, because I hadn’t been living in the country for most of my adult life.  So to get a loan was not straightforward for me.  So I was able to get two – yeah, I didn't have the capital for the purchase of an oyster farm.  I’m like, can I put my bicycle up as collateral? (laughter) I don't have – I don't own anything.  So I was able to get some loans through the Farm Service Agency, which is a branch of the USDA here in Maine, or the state branch of the USDA.  And through them, they have low-interest loans for underserved, minority, or – anyhow, being a woman, I fell under one of those categories – woman farmer.  So I was able to get two different loans from them.  And then I also got a loan through Farm Credit East, which is a loaning service, and I was the first aquaculturist they'd given a loan to in Maine.  So yeah, lots of learning curves there.


        And I also hooked up with SCORE, which is a volunteer network – actually, one of their offices is based in Ellsworth – where they connect like a retired or mature businessperson with a new business owner.  So I asked them – I mean, I was already really familiar with spreadsheets and things like that because of my data science background, but yeah, just like projections and no bookkeeping.  It was a lot of, how hard can it be?  It turns out a lot of it's really hard.  But – yeah.


Q:        [21:04] Sure.  And do you have any experience in advocacy or community-based organizations related to fisheries?


A:        [21:10] Related to fisheries?  No.  I worked in the nonprofit world for many, many years and have done some – I don't know, advocacy is a hot word.  I've done research to help drive policy change.


Q:        [21:30] Sure.  And this is a hard question to answer, I know, before I ask it – but what does an average day of work look like for you?


A:        [21:38] In the on season, it means getting up early, doing all the family things I need to do with my daughter, and then either having my farm manager and farmhand come here and we all carpool up to Mariners Park, which is where I access the farm, or I meet them up there – usually with coffee – and we row out to the boat, which is on a mooring.  And most days, we're doing some level of harvesting, but if we're not harvesting, then we're doing husbandry – so flipping bags, separating bags, or tumbling.  We have a solar-powered tumbler out on a float out on the farm that we built, and last year was the first year that we had it running for the whole season.


        So basically four to six hours on the water, which can be brutal.  We have no cover out there.  But it also can be wonderful.  You know, we work in our bathing suits, and we have swim breaks.  But we crank pretty hard when we're out there, because it always just feels like there's endless things to do.  If it's a harvest day, we wash, count, and bag oysters for wholesale.  The washing takes a few hours.  We have a saltwater wash-down pump that's solar-powered on the float.  So someone’s doing that while two of us are in the boat working the farm, either harvesting or splitting bags or doing whatever needs to be done.


        We come in, and usually if we have two vehicles up there, then we split up, but oysters are delivered to restaurants locally.  And we also do evening events at Tinder Hearth four days a week.  So we get oysters prepped for that and all the gear, plates, tea towels – make sure all of that's ready to go and be picked up.


        And then come back here and fulfill.  We have same-day pickup as long as people put in their orders early-ish, so we're bringing oysters back here.  And we tell people they can pick up their oysters after 3:00, so we have to get back here, bag oysters.  Our port, our woodshed right now is our retail space in the summer, and we sell wine and oyster merchandise and oysters out of there.  So we get that all prepped and ready to receive customers and make sure things are stocked and it looks tidy out there.  That's a day in the busy time.  And usually a shucking event at night.  So go get cleaned up – you know, wash off the mud and put on something nice-looking and go shuck oysters for people for a few hours.


        And then in the winter, you're kind of looking at it. (laughter) Lots of computer work.  I do a ton of grant writing, communication with other farmers, accounting, business, all the admin boring stuff.  Like right now, I'm buying all my licenses for the year and recertifying the retail space and – yeah, I just picked up a boat from Mid-Coast, and soon we'll be shifting into like full gear – buoy prep for launching the boats and raising the farm, which will be a lot of outside work and just sort of assessment of what we need to do and what order we need to do things in.


Q:        [24:56] Thank you.  And how do you feel that your background or your identity shapes your work in the sector, including how others might perceive you?


A:        [25:04] Hmm.  The others – how others may perceive me is something I really am always baffled by, so I don't know how I can answer that.  My background – well, I think there's multiple components there.  One, growing up on this island and having a deep love and connection – like my sense of place is here, and a lot of pride.  But also being an islander, I have a serious chip on my shoulder, (laughter) just because that seems to come to me with the territory here.  So that love of hard work and that Yankee – sort of to a fault, I think – being defined by what you do.  And I try to step back from that on occasion.


        But I think a lot of my business side of things and thinking about how we can do better and how we can be stewards of our environment and actively do good for the water, not just not do bad, comes from my background in microplastics research.  Doing water quality monitoring for many, many years and then working with Adventure Scientists, a nonprofit, to do this global microplastics research project all over the globe really sort of honed that lens for me about how every action we have is making an impact and recognizing as humans we have an impact, but how can we lessen that or use our position sort of as a way to demonstrate different ways of doing things?


Q:        [26:44] How do you feel like your gender plays into that or doesn't?


A:        [26:49] I don't feel like it does, but it probably does.  Yeah, that's not something I really think about.


Q:        [26:59] Sure, yeah.  And how does your role sort of work with your family or caregiving responsibilities?


A:        [27:08] Oh, yeah, that's a hard one.  It's pretty hard to run a business, and I still do research science, so I still do expeditions, and I just came back from Australia for a speaking engagement.  It's a lot.  It's a lot to make sure everyone's getting what they need, including myself.  But my husband's very supportive and is great at holding down the fort when I when I head further afield.  My daughter – I try to bring her with me as much as possible, and she also has spent a lot of time out on the oyster farm, just being like, this is our family business.  This is what we're doing.  Here's a bucket of water (laughter) and a green crab.  You can play for a few hours.


        Yeah, it's a hard balance.  I feel like in the winter, there's a lot more space and a lot more family time and a lot more downtime, and that feels a little bit more like everyone's getting fed.  And in the summer, it's a little bit manic.  But I think that since having her, I've learned a lot about how to delegate things in the business and also like what's just too much and also thinking about what we want this business to look like.  I want to be running the business and not have the business running me, but still be able to make a living.  So it's a constant assessment and balancing of the scales.


        The big thing in the summer is that we only do – Ben and I, my husband and I, only do a handful of events.  Most of that now we hire out to employees.  That just gives us evenings.  Before, she was coming – you know, like she was at every farmer's market, like on my back.  And it was just like, this is a lot for her, for us as a family.  Yeah, having evenings, she'd be like sitting on a cooler while we're shucking oysters.  And it's just like, this is working, but this is not a long-term solution.  So just trying to be aware of, you know, as she grows and the business grows, how we can balance that all out.


Q:        [29:19] Thanks so much.  Now, we're going to sort of shift gears into environmental changes.  If we could start – can you just describe any changes in the marine environment you've noticed, if you've noticed any?


A:        [29:29] Yeah, there's lots of changes in the marine environment.  Definitely more – well, it's hard.  There’s changes and then, yeah, a lot of fluctuations.  The pest situation – I don't know if it's increased, but – I mean, it has increased, but definitely invasive species like Botrylloides, the colonial tunicate.  We also have the sessile – the individual tunicates are really caking our gear.  Some of those are local, are native, and many of them are not.  But the fouling organisms are sort of off the charts.  I just saw that friend of mine in Mid-Coast posted a picture of a giant Chesapeake blue crab.  That's going to be something – when I see one of those here, which I think is not very far off.  And then like the Vibrio, the pathogen – I mean, it's always here, but now with our water temperature spikes, it's just more prevalent.  Also, the risk of it is much higher, because the temperature causes it to proliferate in harvested oysters.


        So on that level, yeah, a lot of changes.  Probably less than some of the old-timers that have really been out there for decades.  I feel like my snapshot is pretty small for Long Cove.  I mean, it's been seven, eight years.  But yeah, I've seen changes in that time.  And I think that two summers ago, we saw a spike of 85-degree water temperatures in the surface water.  And that was appalling, really.  Like we're in Maine.  We're seeing 85-degree temps.  Yeah, and I think that will – I'm just starting to do baseline monitoring of salinity and pH and other sort of water quality parameters that will give us a better idea of how things are changing over time, because I'm interested with my oyster farmer hat on and what that means for the farm and the business, but also just as a scientist and resident of the coast – like how are things changing, and what does that look like?


Q:        [31:39] You saw those 85-degree temperatures three years ago, you said?


A:        [31:42] Two seasons ago.


Q:        [31:43] Two seasons ago?  And have you seen them each successive season?


A:        [31:45] No, we didn't hit it last summer, but last summer was eight weeks of rain.  I don't know if you remember, but I do, because it was miserable out there.  So wet.  I've never worn my foulies so much on the water.  It was brutal out there.  I think we hit mid- to high 70s last summer, which is still plenty warm.  So again, like, OK, if that happens again this year – I mean, we didn’t have oysters spawning.  Maybe a few.  But that's a pretty big shift in what that seasonal work looks like.  If we have spawning oysters all summer, we can't sell them.  So that means – like what does that look like?  The tourist season is in the summer, so how do we move a product and have a successful business if it's spawning in the middle of summer and you can't really harvest them down in the southeast of the US?  Just thinking about ways to mitigate that on our own farm and what that could look like.


Q:        [32:42] How else are you seeing these environmental changes affect the farm and your work?


A:        [32:47] The storms.  The storms are more frequent and more violent.  And the big tides, yeah.


Q:        [32:54] Were you particularly affected by the few recent storms?


A:        [32:57] No, because everything's on the bottom of the ocean, and all our boats and floats are pulled.  So I was very lucky.  The float that we had probably 50 feet up on the shore moved, but didn't get taken away.  Yeah.


Q:        [33:14] Can I ask – I just actually didn't know you couldn't harvest oysters if they're spawning.  I mean, I have heard as it gets warmer, they may actually be spawning and contributing to the wild population, but why is it that – 


A:        [33:24] There's no legal thing.  It's just that they literally are blowing their load.  There’s like very little of an animal left.  They're putting all their energy into their gonads, and then they release their egg and sperm, and then there's this little flaccid post-release creature that is not very salable.  I mean, you could still eat them.  They're just not going to have a lot going on.


Q:        [33:53] And is there anything you've tried in response to sort of cope or adapt to the changes you're seeing?


A:        [33:59] Well, I guess in an indirect way, that's why I've been inspired to – one of the reasons to work on alternative materials, because plastic pollution is a climate change problem – or, you know, intrinsically connected to climate change.  So thinking about if we're going to continue to farm on the ocean, how do we take plastics out of the equation to help secure a future of farming on the ocean?  Because by using a totally unsustainable, polluting, contributing to greenhouse gas material, every step of its production from extraction to landfill, we're really not thinking about the future of aquaculture.


Q:        [34:51] Can you talk a little bit more about what that has looked like to sort of transition away from plastic?


A:        [34:56] Really hard.  It has looked like – we're going into our fourth season of doing R&D on alternatives to plastic and growing oysters.  So that means we've done a bunch of different prototypes, played around with a lot of different designs, played around with a lot of different materials, and tried not to reinvent the wheel in terms of how people cultivate surface oysters.  But it's been a lot of failures, a lot of challenges, but also some successes.  We've honed in on a design that is mirroring what's already existing out there in terms of like that oyster ranch structure and just replacing the plastic components with natural, biodegradable components.


        But the piece with biodegradable – yeah, cool, you want something to biodegrade, but you don't want it to biodegrade in the season.  And it needs to have some longevity, but what does that look like?  And how do you do that without compromising the environmental impact of the product?  So there's just been a ton of challenges and things that you'd never think about until you're standing out there on the water, looking at your gear, and being like, oh, I just lost – I just seeded the cove with a bunch of oysters because I didn't think of this thing.


        So yeah, it's been a lot of learning.  And I’m still – I guess I'm over it now.  But, you know, for years just being like, no one else is doing this?  Like really?  I can't swap ideas with anyone that I found in the state, in the country, in the world.  I'm just rethinking about the material – rethinking the materials we're using.  So yeah, a lot of trial and error, a lot of error. (laughter) 


Q:        [36:45] Do you hope that more people would shift to that?


A:        [36:48] Absolutely.  I'm not just doing this as a fun little art project.  I want to really reimagine what the future of aquaculture could look like without using plastic.  And I want that to be a viable pivot for people in the industry.  And to do that, it needs to be accessible, it needs to be robust, it needs to be tried and true, and it needs to be economically possible.


Q:        [37:12] Yeah, and I'm curious – this really feeds well into the next question.  Like what has made it possible for you to try to do things?


A:        [37:19] Grants.


Q:        [37:20] Grants?


A:        [37:21] And sheer force of will.  Yeah, it's a lot to be running a research project and trying to run a business at the same time, for sure.  And it's definitely impacted – I think if I wasn't doing research, we'd probably be a much more successful business.  But to me, I'm like, what's the point of being in a business if you're not thinking about the future?  So it’s OK.  We're surviving.


Q:        [37:47] Can I ask you – the decision to diversify and include kelp – is it all related to any of these changes, too, or is it for multiple reasons? 


A:        [37:55] Yeah.  Oh, totally.  I mean, I would love to diversify with more species, and also more on on-land diversification in terms of how we maybe do some value-added products.  But again, it's like, I'm already biting off more than I can chew.  But yeah, I think it's absolutely essential to think about diversification for the future of aquaculture, because it is farming, and one storm can wipe out your whole operation.  So having something in your back pocket, having something – I don't think kelp will ever be on the forefront of my business in terms of cashflow.  But this is the slimmest time of year, spring.  You know, I haven't seen any cashflow.  The only cashflow has been out since December.  So harvesting the kelp will give me a little bit of a spring cash infusion.


        I've also put on – I think I have five other seaweed species that I’m legally allowed to grow.  The science is still lagging.  I'm hoping that the Atlantic Sea Farms company I'm working with will come up and take some dulse and do the genetic work from the dulse in Long Cove, because it grows there.


Q:        [39:03] Are you a partner farmer of theirs?


A:        [39:05] Yeah.  And I work with GreenWave as well.  I would love to do sea urchins, even though I don't really want to have to feed something.  And I also have scallops on the lease, but I realize – I think it’s it's too warm in Long Cove.  I could sink them way down on a couple of the lines, but I also – I'm like, I still am just figuring out how to grow oysters really well.  But I think diversification is key.


Q:        [39:29] Are there any other kinds of adaptations that you want to make or are sort of like looking towards the future?  How would that look?


A:        [39:38] Yeah, I have lots.  I just need more time and money for all of them.  So the adaptations that are concretely up and coming are the boat fleet piece.  Part of my business is to – as I mentioned before, not just to do no harm, but to actively do good for the waters that we're in.  And as an oyster farmer, to me, it's like a no-brainer to think about, how can we reduce pollution from our operations in the water that we're operating in?


        One of those is the boat.  Like the boats are inherently toxic.  We're coating them with super-toxic bottom paint that's ablative.  So that's shedding into the water that you're trying to grow oysters in.  You also have an exhaust pipe in the water that you're trying to grow oysters in.  And I use all those things en masse and really trying to think about how I can shift away from that and still have the infrastructure that I need.


        I was lucky enough to be awarded a grant that part of that grant I wrote in a wooden boat.  That is going to start being built in another month or so just a mile down the road from here, and that will be sealed with pine tar and linseed and non-toxic sealants, and we'll see how that goes.  We'll build a wooden boat and ideally have an electric outboard.  I'm still in discussion with that.  And I really – just the technology's gone in leaps and bounds from a few years ago, but it's not quite where I would love to see it as a producer in terms of battery and charging.


        So I would love to be able to have a – I mean, there's been like the green boating term around for a long time, but it's kind of green boating light.  I would like to go green boating heavy and really have a non-toxic boat fleet out there.  And that also could involve welded aluminum boats in the future, too, because the maintenance is really low on those.


Q:        [41:48] Thank you.  What is your biggest concern for the marine environment for the future of fishing and aquaculture in Maine?


A:        [41:55] Biggest?  I don’t know.  There's so many. (laughter)


Q:        [41:59] A way to maybe reframe that that might be useful is like if you could tell policymakers, what's the most important thing to think about, what would you tell them?


Q:        [42:10] You can also pick more than one.


A:        [42:11] There's so many.  I mean, with my plastic background, it's like we are literally putting like a Valdez oil spill worth of plastic into the ocean every season between lobster gear and aquaculture.  And really, on the rule-making side, we need to have more funds available to do more robust research and development around alternatives to those materials or making those materials more robust.  Because again, this is just a piece of the giant climate change puzzle and also a piece of the future of fisheries.  We know it’s not just plastic that’s the problem.  It’s all the chemicals, hazardous chemicals that are associated and come along with plastic.  The carrying capacity in the ocean – the whole thing in the ’70s, the solution to pollution is dilution, just no longer can apply.  We're really creating a very toxic soup out there.  That sounds a little extremist, but I think that without making changes, we aren't going to have a future that we can grow food in our ocean or harvest food in our ocean.


Q:        [43:27] Thank you.  Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training or programs?


A:        [43:34] Training?  I'm doing this oyster lifecycle assessment with Island Institute (sp?) and an organization from the Netherlands.  I can't remember the name.  I’m mad, because I know this is being recorded.  I don't know – this guy, yeah.  And I'm also doing – also the Island Institute – I'm doing the BUD program, Baseline – B-something data.  Basically, I have this thing hooked up to my outboard, and it monitors how much outboard time I have in a season.  That's with Sam Belknap at Island Institute.  I’m also doing another climate change – mostly just surveys and interviews, but yeah, collecting some data for them, too.


Q:        [44:33] What strategies do you think would be effective in building resilience against these climate-related impacts that you're seeing?


A:        [44:41] Strategies – you mean in terms of like top-down stuff?


Q:        [44:45] Sure.


A:        [44:47] I think having some flexibility in some of the rules for people to be able to innovate and test things out, because without that, it's not going to happen.  I think that creating funding or finding funding or making funding channels accessible to people who want to try things needs to happen, too, because you can't expect a small business just to be fronting money to try something on a whim.


        I also think that maybe some – especially in terms of shellfish.  You know how we have like local shellfish committees?  Having something similar for aquaculture and maybe also zoning in terms of looking at Maine waters.  Because sometimes when we talk about statewide changes, it's really slow and clunky, and also something that's applicable in Casco Bay is not applicable in Cobscook Bay for example.  So having a little bit more light on your feet oversight I think would be really beneficial.  Also, we're not a huge state.  There's no reason why we couldn't have a little bit more personalized sector – regions – and then sort of more self-managed.


Q:        [46:13] Are there any changes that are impacting your work that are maybe not environmental?  You had mentioned earlier the selling out of the house and that being an issue.


A:        [46:19] Oh, yeah.  I think I'm three years now waiting for a lease to go through and another standard commercial oyster and kelp lease the next cove over.  To me, that's just unacceptable for the state to be – I mean, I already have my foot in the door.  I've shown that I'm a good aquaculturist.  But anyone who wants to get into the industry, if they have to wait three years for a lease to go through, then you have to wait two or three years to grow an oyster.  It’s like, that's not a business plan.  That's not a business.  You can't do that.  So there absolutely needs to be more staffing and capacity and resources put in at the Department of Marine Resources to help pull this industry.  Everyone’s touting or saying like, oh, aquaculture is the future of the Gulf of Maine.  It's like, yeah, but none of the infrastructure has reflected that in terms of staffing or making this actually accessible to anyone.  And I'm worried that the way it's going now is that it's really favoring big business and larger corporations, because they have the time and the money and the lawyers to make it happen.  And it's going to push out those smaller farmers, and we're going to see a repeat of what's happened with industrialized agriculture on land.


Q:        [47:38] Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes that you've seen in your time working on the water?


A:        [47:46] There has been a lot of great funding through COVID and through Janet Mills' office for access to diversification within the seafood industry.


Q:        [48:00] And you had mentioned this a little earlier, but you really see diversification as like the way forward?  Or do you, I guess?


A:        [48:06] It's a way forward.  I think it depends on your business model.  And I think diversification can take a lot of different flavors.  It doesn't necessarily have to be species diversification.  But I think it's really important when your business and your livelihood rely on the climate that you have to recognize the world that we currently live in.


Q:        [48:28] And what is like a hopeful vision for the future of Maine's fisheries for you and aquaculture?


A:        [48:32] Well, to be totally selfish, my hope is that there is en masse interest in moving away from plastics to grow our food in and that through some of our work that has made accessible – and it is really a viable alternative for people to incorporate into their farms as they think about buying new gear – as new farmers enter the industry that this seems like a real option for them to delve into, so we can think about  disruptive innovation.  And hopefully that would then go on to spur and incite change within people's businesses, not just on the water.  So really create a much more robust and sustainable – even though it's an overused word, sustainable food-growing system into the future.


Q:        [49:29] Great.  Have you noticed any changes in women's presence, participation, or status over time in fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [49:35] I'd say there's a lot more women in aquaculture than there was.  I remember a conference I went to maybe the first year I bought the farm – Northeast Aquaculture, NACE – one of the big northeast aquaculture conferences – and I've definitely felt like very much the minority.  I was like, cool, there's like a bunch of boomers and maybe a generation older than me white men, and like a handful of women out of the few hundred people here.  And when I went to – I was just there at NACE in Providence in January, and I was like, wow, it's very much shifted.  I mean, there's still plenty of old white men – we are in New England – but a lot more minority representation, a lot more Indigenous, and a lot of women.  So that's been pretty heartening to see.  And it makes it really fun to – not to say it's not fun to collaborate with men, but there's definitely a camaraderie, I think, within women in aquaculture that did not exist even five years ago.


Q:        [50:42] Great.  Is there anything else you want to talk about in this interview?


A:        [50:48] Not that I can think of.


Q:        [50:50] Hillary, do you have any – 


Q:        [50:51] I have a few, like slightly – just kind of all bouncing around different places.  As a partner farmer for ASF, do you just – you dry your seaweed, but they pick it up and process?


A:        [50:59] No, no, no.


Q:        [51:00] Or they buy it wet, right?


A:        [51:02] That's the cincher.


Q:        [51:05] So they do all the processing – working.


A:        [51:06] Yeah.  Yeah.


Q:        [51:07] So you have a contract with them and they buy.


A:        [51:09] Correct.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm in a three-year contract with them.  I also have one line of my own seaweed that I bought from Springtide (sp?) down in Gouldsboro.  But the thing with Atlantic Sea Farms is that they came and got source tissue from Long Cove, because my big concern is that we are doing genetic mishaps that we don't even know that we're doing.  Because we know there's a ton of subspecies and nuanced things happening in all these different coves, and I feel much more comfortable participating in this if I know that I'm growing Long Cove kelp in Long Cove, not Casco Bay or whatever.


Q:        [51:47] I didn’t even realize it was that localized.  That’s really cool.


A:        [51:49] I mean, no one knows.  There's just – there's not – 


Q:        [51:52] Oh, I mean, just that they – 


A:        [51:53] Yeah, they came from – 


Q:        [51:54] – source the seed that locally.


A:        [51:55] Well, I insisted. (laughter) So the stuff that you see drying there by the wood stove is – this morning, I went out – and I'm doing this sampling for GreenWave as well, which is they're doing – that’s climate – this goes into the climate change thing – baseline climate data on temperature and growth and how that looks all up and down New England.  So monthly I'm going out and measuring and weighing a foot of kelp on the line, and I have a temperature logger out there.  That, otherwise, I would just compost, because it's whatever.  So I'm like, I'll just dry it and eat it.


Q:        [52:33] You mentioned green crab just as something to entertain your daughter, and you mentioned blue crabs showing up.  I was just wondering – I know green crabs have been here for a long time, but they are increasing due to climate change.  And I know they prey on invertebrates, mostly the soft-shell clams.


A:        [52:49] Oh, they are –


Q:        [52:51] But I was going to say, are you concerned about that?  Does that impact you?


A:        [52:53] Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  They are one of the – they create a lot of mortality on the farm.  And my background in green crabs is that I did a peninsula-wide trapping effort many, many – over a decade ago, probably almost 15 years ago, when they were first really started spiking.  And all the clammers – everyone was talking about them.  I did a trapping effort and tried to find markets for them.  That didn't happen.  My chef friends took some, but they're not super-easy to do anything with.


        I mean, all these invasive species definitely impact oysters.  If there's a green crab in a bag, you hear it as soon as you pick it up.  You're like, damn it.  They can eat like a dozen oysters in a day.  They drift in when they're little, and then they grow.  And they get big, and they get trapped in the bag, and they just eat whatever they want.  So that's why you got to get (inaudible).


Q:        [53:47] Is there anything – you're trying to cope with that, or is there not much you can do?


A:        [53:50] Just check.  Just get in those bags more frequently.  Yeah.


Q:        [53:55] And then I just wanted to clarify – you talked about when you first started farming – were you the first sea farmer, aquaculturist, on Deer Isle, or were there a few others?


A:        [54:04] Danny Weed established it.


Q:        [54:06] Oh, right.  Sorry, they started the farm.  It sort of was the first – your farm was the first farm.


A:        [54:10] Yeah, yeah.  And now there's two other farms here, and maybe there's going to be another LPA up in Little Deer Isle.


Q;        [54:22] And then just one last general question is like – it's just interesting and unique, your research background.  I just was trying to get the picture of – like what was your educational background?  Probably at some point you went away and studied somewhere else.


A:        [54:36] Yeah, I did K-12 here, locally.  I did a year or half a year abroad as well in South America.  And then I went to Australia and did my undergrad in Australia – bachelor of science.  And yeah, did my master's of philosophy and human ecology at College of the Atlantic just a few years ago.  Yeah, did that.


Q:        [55:04] With Chris Petersen?


A:        [55:06] Yeah, because we were pals from marine education, and the organization I was working for when I was running the global project – they're like, hey, would you want to go back to grad school?  And I called – I mean, since I didn't do my undergrad here, I don't really have a network in the academic world.  But I called some people at University of Maine.  They're like, yeah, you can come and do our PhD program.  It's full-time, and you have to do a ton of 101 classes.  And I'm like, fuck that.  I'm not going to quit my job to do a job on research – or do a degree on research.  So I called Chris, and like 20 minutes into the call, he's like, you should just come to COA.  I’ll be your supervisor, and you can get your master's.  I'm like, great, I'll do that.  So they were really flexible, and I was able to roll my consulting work into a master's program.  It was definitely enough for a PhD, but they don't offer a PhD.  So yeah, I did that and wrapped up the project, had my baby, and graduated in 2018.


Q:        [56:09] Thank you.  That was really helpful to get that whole picture.  Yeah, that was my last questions.


Q:        [56:14] Great.  Well, then I'll go ahead and turn this off unless you have anything else you want to add.


A:        [56:16] I don't think so.


Q:        [56:17] All right.  Great.

"3","Q:        [0:00] So, we usually like to start with just, how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:04] I'm Trixie. (laughter) Do I get into my position and things?  


Q:        [0:10] Sure.  


A:        [0:11] OK.  My name is Trixie Betz.  I'm the Outreach and Development Specialist at the Maine Aquaculture Association, and I use she/her pronouns,


Q:        [0:18] Great.  And what year were you born?  


A:        [0:20] 1999.


Q:        [0:21] Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:23] So, I grew up in Westchester County, New York, which is about an hour and a half north of New York City.  I was born in Manhattan and grew up outside because my dad worked in the city.  But for as many summers as I can remember, we would go up to Maine, and originally would spend summers in different places, and then settled in Brooksville, Maine, which is on Penobscot Bay.  So, spend the years in New York, come up here for the summers, and grew up sailing and spending a ton of time outside.  Maine was kind of like a second home to me.  I lived in New York for all eighteen years, and then I started college.  I went to a small college in Western Mass, and during that time, my parents moved to Maine year-round, so I was still returning in the summers, but they were there through the rest of the year.  So, I was coming back holidays.  


Then, I decided to take time off, which ended up being during the COVID spring.  I was taking a semester off when the pandemic started in March, and it totally changed my priorities and where I wanted to be.  I ended up spending a year out of school and transferring to UMaine.  That's my permanent Maine origin story.  But I'm originally a New Yorker, and there's definitely some – I have a lot of inherent New York qualities that is funny to bring to Maine.


Q:        [2:02] Cool.  Yeah, I bet.  Are your parents from New York?  Where are they from?


A:        [2:05] My mom is from Brookfield, Connecticut, and my dad is from New Hampshire.  They met in Boston and then moved to New York, and that's where myself and all my siblings were born.  


Q:        [2:16] And what do they do?  


A:        [2:18] My brother lives in Chicago.  He does technical writing, and he's in a band.  He's a really creative person.  Then my younger sister goes to UMaine Farmington.  She's studying abroad in Ireland right now, and she's a huge history buff.  She probably knows more about the Civil War than most of the teachers in her school. (laughter) She loves history.  We’re all creatives.  We all love to be creative.  


Q:        [2:50] Do your parents have creative careers?  What did they do when you were growing up?


A:        [2:54] Yeah.  My dad was a TV commercial editor, and that was something that he self-taught.  Neither of my parents went to college, so I'm also first gen.  I’m the person in my family to graduate college, and they are both pretty creative people, whether it's the culinary arts or digital and media arts.  I was raised – they tried to get me to play instruments.  I didn't want to do that.  They tried to get me to do sports.  I didn't want to do that.  So, I was left to my own devices with my crafts.  I’m definitely a crafter at heart, and I've just always done that – so many different types of media.  Right now, I'm on a big sewing kick, but I think that definitely translates into what I've found as a fulfilling career or what I wanted to do.  Those creative elements are really important to me.


Q:        [3:52] Cool.  I want to come back to that definitely before we get there.  Do you have any history of fishing or working in the water in your family?


A:        [3:59] Not at all.  I mean, being from New York, there isn't a ton of that, except maybe coming from the Sound, which my family does not.  Maybe some recreational fishing, but nothing super notable.  But I grew up spending time on the water sailing and also growing up sailing in the most robust region for lobster fishing.  So, there were always conversations about shared water use in terms of recreation and commercial use.  You can't avoid it up there in Deer Isle, Stonington, and Blue Hill.  I think I was definitely exposed to it.  There's sort of a different dynamic up there than there is down here in Brunswick.  Every working waterfront is different, but coming from the recreational side, I recognized the need to appreciate that other side and how important it was to the community that I was in, especially going from a summer resident, which has its own kind of connotations, to a year-round resident.  But I'm the only person in my family who's engaged in any type of commercial marine work.  Should I get into –


Q:        [5:17] I think I'll come back to how you got into it.  Can you describe those sailing experiences a little more?  I'm just curious how you found that relationship with commercial fishermen.


A:        [5:25] Yeah, so I grew up sailing at Bucks Harbor Yacht Club.  I started when I was seven, and I hated it when I first started.  I was so scared of water.  I didn't like seaweed touching me, and it was a struggle.  But it was like, “You're going to camp.”  My parents were like, “You will go to camp, and we're dropping you off, and you will learn to love this.”  They had no sailing background, but they were like, “We want you to do this, you and your siblings to pursue this.”  I eventually fell in love with it.  Sailing in a harbor with a ton of other fishing boats – and it's the harbor that is featured in One Morning in Maine by Robert McCloskey, which talks about Condon's Garage and going to the market and an image of what a Maine harbor looks like, and a lot of those have very functional and active working waterfront elements.  


Coming from the Yacht Club side and being a kid in a sailing camp was a little bit different.  I eventually graduated from that program and started teaching there, and then I was program director for one year, and just gained a bunch of skills in terms of teaching kids, and then also recognizing what a great opportunity it was to spend time on the water, and the relationship that you develop with being on the water.  Coming from a kid who was like, “I hate this.  I don't appreciate this at all,” and then being the person who's creating that experience for other kids, which is really rare and not many people – it's a total privilege to get to experience that.  


I don't know necessarily that that's like super intertwined with fishing and aquaculture, but being on the water, you can't avoid it.  I think it imbued in me a comfort on the water and appreciation for even getting to be out there and getting to make my money working on the water, not producing food.  I remember thinking it’s going to be hard to top this job.  This is the best job you could ever have.  It's just like being out in a boat every day.  Yes, it's in the summer, and it's not in the winter, but I'm noticing how that continues to be relevant to my experience today and how there are common threads that I didn't even know about at that time that have brought me to where I am with my career now.


Q:        [8:03] That’s super cool.  Can you describe some of those common threads?  I want to continue on this story.


A:        [8:10] Yeah, I'm just thinking about this now, but having that summer job that was the dream summer job and having this narrative of, “I will never enjoy myself as much at a job again.  No other job I can have will be as fun.  I won't get as much fresh air.  I won't be working with other young, fun people that I like.  This is a unicorn, and I'm not going to find this again.  I better set my expectations really low because when I have to have a career and a job in the real world using whatever I studied in college, it's going to be a reality check.  This was nice, but it's a point in time.”  Realizing now that that's not true, I think that having a job that I really loved and checked a lot of those boxes would be an essential element of the kinds of careers I would want to pursue and what I would say I would do, and what I would say I don't really want to pursue, or I don't want to have this kind of job that requires me to do X-Y-Z.  


I think I realized that more and more every day, and something I appreciate so much about my job now and I really like to communicate to other people because I see so many young people who are so set to – they’re not going to like their job, or having a job or having a career, you have to have low expectations, or you're not going to like your first job, and you're also not going to like your second job, and you might like your third job, and eventually you get somewhere where you want to be.  I just have so many peers who don't like what they do but feel like they don't have any choice or they just have to suck it up.  I'm here to tell them that that's not true.  If you can find a role that you really enjoy and is fun, you can totally pursue that and have it be a really valid professional career.  Your job can be fun.  I'm always telling people, “Your job can be fun.”  I think coming from having those experiences, especially on the water, and recognizing that's not just a want but a need now, for me, is really cool and, I think, really relates to that version of myself that I was five or six years ago doing that.


Q:        [10:49] Cool.  Thank you so much.  Can you describe a little bit your educational background and how you feel that's moved you to where you are now?  


A:        [10:57] Yeah.  So, I was really into creative writing in middle school and high school.  I had originally thought – I was a humanities person.  I originally thought I would pursue something in the humanities, whether that was creative writing, English, or something, or maybe political science.  I was really interested in social justice and things like that.  I started my college career at Smith College and pursued – my first semester, I took a Spanish class.  I didn't take Spanish through all of high school.  I only took it, I think, maybe the last two years.  I took Latin up until that point.  But in my first semester, I was like, “I'll just take a variety of classes,” and I took a Spanish class and met all my best friends in that class.  The professor was also new to the school and was like, “We're figuring this out all together.  I also don't know what I'm doing.  Let's just figure it out.”  I just fell in love with it.  


Also, as a first gen college student, I was feeling a little bit like I really want to get the most out of my college experience, not to make up for the fact that my parents didn't go, but it's like there's extra value to that as it's such a privilege for me to even be here that I better make the most of that experience.  So, in terms of thinking, “How do I get bang for my buck in my college career,” I thought that learning a language was the most valuable that would also not pigeonhole me into you study this, and now you need to pursue this.  You got an engineering degree.  You have to become an engineer – or pre-med or whatever.  I knew that learning a language, I could take it with me for the rest of my life and use it in professional ways and personal ways.  I think learning a language is one of the best things you can do for your brain.  


So, I decided that I would major in Spanish and then also decide whether I wanted to do a double major, Spanish and English, Spanish and history, or poli sci.  Then, I took some Film and Media Studies classes and realized there was a lot of overlap in the Spanish department and Film and Media Studies.  A lot of my Spanish classes were about film.  Not a lot of my film classes had anything to do with Spanish, but there was a lot of overlap in terms of how do you learn a language.  Learning it through film is a very cool way to do that.  Also, it was a way to have cross-listed courses to do a double major.  


So, I declared a double major in film and Spanish.  Film kind of came from – I was exposed to it a lot through my dad.  He didn't do production, but my parents were very insistent on a film education and showing me really good movies.  I really appreciated those.  I just thought it was a very cool thing to be a part of.  Smith is by no means a film school.  So, we had a very limited media lab in terms of the kind of cameras you could check out.  Nothing was very high-tech, but the classes were a lot of fun, and I just thought it would be very cool – a mix of my creative interests, and then – I don't know.  I guess language learning is also a creative interest.  


So, I was pursuing that, and then I – in the middle of my junior year, decided to take a semester off and simultaneously found out that I couldn't afford to go there anymore.  It was kind of a mix of “I don't think I want to be here,” taking a mental health break, and then also, “I can't be here.”  A very odd time.  This one piece I don't think should go in, but I would like to share it. (Redacted). 


So, I left school.  Now we can start again.  Destroy that. (laughter) I left Smith and was reevaluating where I wanted to go, what I wanted to do, possibly thinking, “How can I do that without a degree?” –being in that scenario.  I was looking at maybe doing “Teaching English as a Second Language” courses because that's more affordable than a degree.  Then, the pandemic started in March.  I was living in Brooksville and working full-time to afford to go back to school.  The pandemic started, and everything changed.  It became clear that everyone was having to reevaluate. 


I ended up applying to UMaine after several months of just working and navigating that, got in, and did a remote semester in spring of 2021 with the plan of studying Spanish.  It just made the most sense in terms of the difference between the Media Studies Department at both schools.  The credits just wouldn't have transferred.  So, I transferred to UMaine, and then I started in person in September and did a bunch of summer classes.  I only did my senior year at UMaine.  So, arriving in the beginning of your senior year after everyone hasn't been there, it's a very odd dynamic.  


I absolutely loved UMaine, and the Spanish department was fantastic.  I majored in Spanish and minored in criminal justice, and just had a great time.  I met my career partner there, and it's the beginning of my story of being introduced to aquaculture.  I knew nothing about aquaculture.  I have no science background – that's not my strength – just an ocean appreciation and a love for the ocean.  But my partner has an oyster farm in Brunswick, and it was something that when we were first seeing each other, I was like, “I don't know much about that.  Seems pretty cool, but that's his thing.”  I don't want to get ahead of myself, but sticking to the education thread, I don't have any background in marine studies, marine bio or oceanography, or anything related to the ocean.


Q:        [18:41] Cool.  


A:        [18:43] Because I can start from the day I was born and arrive here.  I just keep talking.


Q:        [18:48] Which I love.  That’s fabulous.  We can get back to that.  Two quick questions.  Are you married?


A:        [18:52] No.


Q:        [18:55] Do you have any children?


A:        [18:56] No.


Q:        [18:57] Great.  Can you describe your role in the fishing or aquaculture industry in Maine?  And then I think that'll let you pick right back up.


A:        [19:03] Yeah.  So, I work in aquaculture communications at the Maine Aquaculture Association.  I lead their communications right now.  I'm the only communication staff person that we have.  But communication means a lot of different things.  We are a trade association, which means we represent industry.  We can partner with different people on research, but we're primarily providing services to our members who pay dues.  I help with a lot of the storytelling, which I think links back to my creative interests in videography and interest in film production.  But there are a lot of different things that go into storytelling, whether it's using social media to do that, email, newsletter, video production, event planning.  I basically try to tell the story of Maine aquaculture to build support, to create a love for the industry, to have transparency within the industry in terms of what aquaculture is.  Not a lot of people know that.  Even people who live on the coast of Maine have a very fuzzy idea of what aquaculture is.  A lot of them.  


I try to do a lot of education, humanization through storytelling, tapping into the emotion, and use a bunch of different tactics to reach different audiences in terms of what matters to them to educate about aquaculture.  A lot of that is in person.  A lot of that is digital campaigns.  The Maine Aquaculture Association does a lot of different things.  Outside of the communications, we have my coworker, Christian, who's a project manager, and he provides business planning support, financial advice, one-on-one business planning with growers, and he also develops economic impact reports.  Then, my boss, our Executive Director, Sebastian Belle, runs the show, and he lobbies in the legislature for aquaculture to promote aquaculture in the state and is very well connected in the whole network of the state and leads the charge for us.


Q:        [21:33] Great.  Can you talk a little bit about how you got into that?


A:        [21:37] Yeah, perfect.  So, like I said, I have no background in aquaculture or marine biology, which is a misconception.  You don't need a background in marine biology to do anything in aquaculture except maybe the really technical jobs, like technicians and scientists.  Anyway, I graduated in May 2022 and decided I would move down to live near my partner in Brunswick.  I was working at a restaurant that summer, trying to piece together what direction I wanted to go in now that I had my degree.  I decided some things were not working out, and so I decided to leave that job.  My partner's farm was losing two of their staff, who were college and high school students going back to school in September, and I was ready for something new and asked If I could work on the farm for two weeks while I figured out what other job I would have because you invariably find your dream job after two weeks, and that's what I thought would happen.  


I started working there in August, and I was working under his dad, who is a really great guy, high energy, really cares about what he does, and a really hard worker.  We were working out there and ended up hiring someone that my partner and I both knew from school.  She had a marine biology background but also no aquaculture.  Surprisingly, at UMaine, wasn't super exposed to it.  We eventually became super close, and two weeks turned into six months.  I absolutely fell in love with the work I was doing, the community surrounding it.  I had skills in terms of being on the water, getting wet, being out in the rain.  Boat driving is honestly – boat driving and knot tying are the biggest skills that you need if you want to be an oyster farmer.  Seeing a lot of my peers sitting at desks, I was so grateful for that opportunity and considered myself really lucky, but was also kind of like, “Grass is always greener,” trying to look for – “What is my career?”  Not realizing it was right in front of my face.


I worked there into January and met a ton of different people in the community and started to realize some of what I should have been looking for in a career.  Do I like getting up every morning and going to work?  Does everyone else seem to feel that way, too?  Do I like those people?  Do I feel like I'm making a difference?  Those are all things I felt while working on the oyster farm, but I think was still kind of – yeah, grass is always greener, looking for where I should be, not where I could be.  


That was kind of my introduction to aquaculture and the exposure to that community and meeting a lot of really important and influential people.  And then, after the season wrapped up in January, I decided I would strike out on my own.  I worked briefly at a traditional marketing job, which wasn't a good fit for me.  It’s also hard to go from working outside every day to working at a desk, but I realized that aquaculture was where I wanted to be, so I left that job after a very brief stint there and just started applying to other jobs that were related to aquaculture – really, anything I could find, piecing together a hodgepodge of what my experiences had been, which is hard and daunting.  A lot of recent grads don't have a ton of experience to put on their resume, but depending on what you're applying to, you'd be surprised what is valuable.  


Something that I recognized – some of the most valuable experience, which makes me good at what I do today, is my food service experience, in terms of interacting with every type of person on the planet and being able to problem solve and think on your feet is really important.  I'm getting off track.  I had recognized that aquaculture was the community that I wanted to be in and was applying to aquaculture jobs.  And then applied to my current role in April or May, interviewed, and got the gig and started in June under my previous supervisor, Afton Vigue, who had been in my role originally, and then I was the first addition to a communications team in terms of making it more than one person.  She was the first communications person they'd ever brought on.  So, a lot of trailblazing was done on her part.  Yeah.  I've just loved it ever since.


Q:        [26:49] Great.  Can you tell me a little bit about what your work looked like when you were working on the farm?


A:        [26:55] Yeah.  Day-to-day on the farm would be a pretty early start.  Where we were operating out of was tidal, so two hours on either side of low tide, you weren't able to leave from or get back to the dock.  So, some days, that would be a 5:00 AM start, and some days, we'd have to push the start time a little later, and it was basically just preparing oysters for harvest and making sure that they were growing well.  


The farm I was working on was all surface culture, and so day-to-day, would be tumbling oysters, culling oysters, sorting them by quality and then putting them back out to grow out, and doing something called defouling, which is flipping oyster cages up onto their pontoons to be exposed to the air and sunlight to kill off a lot of biofouling, and then flipping them back down, and just a lot of oyster handling, decreasing density in cages where density got too high so that oysters can continue to filter freely, bringing oysters to harvest every Monday and Wednesday.  Those are usually really early start days, just washing and counting and bagging and tagging and icing and then shipping them down to Portland.  And then problem-solving where issues came up – in a cage got free, or something got tangled, or the motor stopped working on the tumbler, a lot of – “What's today's issue? Are we going to solve it by the end of the day so that we can continue to tumble oysters for next week's harvest that won't run into the harvest after that?” 


It was the kind of work that I felt like I could do and I could be proud of, and then I could leave my job and leave my work there, which is a hard thing to do now. (laughter)


Q:        [29:06] Yeah.  Can you talk a little bit more about what that looks like in your current role?


A:        [29:10] What do you mean?


Q:        [29:13] Your roles, responsibilities, maybe an average day, if that's a useful structure.


A:        [29:17] Yeah.  I do a lot of emailing – a lot of answering emails.  I'm usually the person that people try to contact if they need something from the MAA or they want to talk to us.  I do a lot of communicating with our members directly and also (inaudible) who are not members through email.  I spend a lot of my day on email.  But then also we have sort of longer-term projects of creating content.  So, one of my biggest roles is to manage our social media platforms and create content to go on there, whether it's videos or advertising for an event that people can attend or re-sharing other people's content.  There are a lot of growers who make really fun content in the state, and so we just use our platform to leverage what they make.  They are also helping the mission of transparency – this is what a farmer looks like, and this is what a farm looks like.  


I work on doing a lot of original video content.  Right now, I’m storyboarding for the summer in terms of video production so that I can execute those and go out and shoot my video and not have the summer completely get away from me like it did last summer.  Granted, it was my first summer, so I was onboarding.  I have really ambitious video projects lined up.  There's a lot of different little things that crop up in the aquaculture space all the time that we respond to, whether it's some misinformation has been put out, or this town is discussing making significant changes to – I don't know – all sorts of things.  There are a lot of conversations happening on the town level that we try to address and – I don't know – help support growers in those areas to respond to those because we have the resources and maybe the time because we're not out on farms every day to do that.  


I really try to prioritize whatever it is that I can do to support our growers because they're busy farming and running their businesses.  Anything that I can do, whether it's the storytelling or getting legislators out on farms because they're ultimately making a lot of the decisions about the aquaculture industry.  Communications is like an ever-evolving animal, and so I'm always having to adapt to what I thought my day would be and taking a lot of meetings.  We do a lot of collaboration with other organizations, which I think is very cool about the Maine aquaculture space.  Not a lot of it is very competitive, even between growers.  Growers will share information on their best practices with each other, and we collaborate with other organizations because we all have a shared mission in terms of aquaculture support and education.  


Even though I'm right now the only person on the communications team, I'm never really fully alone on the projects I'm working on.  Usually, I'm partnering with – whether it's Maine Sea Grant, Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center, or ARI, Aquaculture Research Institute, there's a lot of collaborating that happens.  So, I'd say my days are full of working with other people while just being at my desk.  


Q:        [32:40] Yeah, that's super cool, and those projects are really exciting.  I'm curious.  You described aquaculture as being really collaborative, right?  I feel like we've heard other people say that.  Do you have any hunches on why you think aquaculture is that way?


A:        [32:57] I think it depends on which part of it we're talking about.  I think possibly in the oyster space, yes, there's competition in terms of markets, but the oyster market is also based on variety and the uniqueness of every individual brand.  I think that there's a lot of collaboration there in terms of everyone is producing the same species and is able to do branding to different extents.  But most of the oyster events, are always celebrations and almost like socials between growers.  I don't know if it comes from the fact that everyone really cares about what they do, really genuinely, and recognizes the impact that the work that they do has and is farming for a reason beyond this is a small business opportunity that I could have.  It really lends itself to the idea of a rising tide lifts all ships in terms of if I'm able to advocate for the industry at large, even if that means advocating for another operation, who is technically my competition, it benefits everybody.  


That’s the story that we try to tell, as well.  Even through running your own small business and having to tend to that, there's a lot of advocacy for the industry that happens through every single farmer's brand.  I think in the NGO space, the nonprofit space that I'm in, it just makes sense to.  There's only so many resources that go around, and there's no reason to compete.  We're not making money off of the campaigns that we're doing.  We are primarily grant-funded, and so are most of the organizations in the state.  Like I said, any way that we can collaborate on things just means greater reach and greater impact.  We all have our own – Maine Sea Grant might have more of the science community, and we have a lot of direct connection with growers.  So, leveraging both of those to make sure that – whether it's impact reports that we're putting out or video campaigns that we're running have the most impact relies on relying on each other. 


Q:        [35:27] Cool.  Thank you.  I'm going to ask you questions about your experience.  I think you've already touched on a lot of these things.  If there's anything that you've missed or feel like you really want to include, feel free.  Do you have any experience in bookkeeping, bait, or gear preparation?


A:        [35:45] I don't know about book – I don't think I have bookkeeping experience, no accounting or anything.  I've served in some administrative assistant roles.  So, I’m pretty organized.  In terms of gear preparation, working on the farm required us to do a lot of gear maintenance, and there were nasty days that I spent building bags and fixing cages.  I think that's just part of working on a small farm.  There's no one else to do it, so you just have to figure it out, and that means having the hog ring clamp and the hog rings and just fixing holes.  No really formal gear preparation, but you're having to make those kinds of repairs all the time just working on a farm. 


Q:        [36:39] Great.  And I feel like you've definitely touched on this, but if there's anything else you want to talk about – what about processing, marketing, trade, that kind of stuff?  


A:        [36:46] I had a very brief stint in terms of a traditional marketing job, and I learned a lot of the basics there in a very brief amount of time that I think I've just built upon in my current role.  I've always been involved in little side video projects growing up, whether it was in my high school video production class or then in college studying Film and Media Studies.  I've always had a keen interest in that and liked executing it at a small level with just what I have at my disposal.  That's something that I knew when I started at the MAA wasn't necessarily outlined in my job, but I thought video content has a lot of impact, and people really enjoy video content, and it accomplishes a lot of things that traditional written media or still images doesn't.  In that way, I've been able to tweak this role or make that a priority in my current role based off of my background experience and do it in a really cost-effective and small-scale way while also producing really good quality content if I do say so myself.  


I don't know.  I use social media, so you learn a lot about using social media or about working with social media through using social media.  But I think primarily what's been most influential in my career now is my time spent on the water as a farmer because it makes it a lot easier for me to know how to tell a farmer story, having been a farmer myself and how hard that work is and how difficult it is when things go wrong.  I think that has been one of the most pivotal experiences that I've had in terms of what I do now, and I really have valued that time.  I miss it a lot, especially when the weather gets nice like it is now, being outside.  In the winter, it's nice to be at my desk, but in the summer – in the summer, I do a lot of field trips and field visits to visit operations that I haven't seen.  I'm going to see a salmon farm on Tuesday, and that's going to be very cool.  But all my time is not spent at my desk.  In the summer, I am out in the field a lot, whether that's shooting content, meeting people that I need to meet, hosting events or attending events, I still get to be outside which I think I need.  That's a necessity.  


Q:        [39:36] Cool.  I also think you've talked about this a lot, but if there's anything else you feel compelled to share, what about any experience you have with community-based organization, activism in the fisheries space?


A:        [39:52] I don't know that I have activism in the fisheries space.


Q:        [39:54] Aquaculture and fisheries.  Marine industry, I guess.


A:        [39:57] I think you can't help but get into that as a grower because we're so on the cutting edge of the industry right now, and it's so in its infancy.  Myself, as one farm hand on one farm can actually have a pretty big impact in terms of that storytelling.  The people that I interact with at a shucking event well before I started my current job – for many, that's their first exposure to a conversation about aquaculture.  I think that by nature of working in the industry, you gain a lot of skills in terms of advocating for the industry.  You can't help but not, or you can't help but do that, and you learn a lot about – it's very easy to advocate for the industry when you actually really believe in and care about what it is that you're doing.  It's just a no-brainer at that point.  I don't need to be trained in how to do it because, speaking from my personal experience of how important it was to me to work on this farm in a team of three, two of whom were women – two of whom were young women starting their careers – that is such an easy story to tell and make it very genuine and heartfelt because it's true.  I would call that a level of activism, and it's definitely advocacy to some extent, but not necessarily in the formalized way.  But everyone learns how to do that because they know that we are on the leading edge of this wave, and that's the kind of impact that we can have.  


Q:        [41:38] Yeah, that's really amazing.  Thank you for sharing that.  I'm curious, segueing away from that, how do you feel like your identity or your background has shaped that work?  You mentioned being a woman working with women.  Can you talk a little bit more about that?


A:        [41:52] Yeah.  I went to a women's college for two and a half years.  That shaped a lot for me in terms of what I expect from spaces that I'm in, and what I – yeah, what I expect from spaces that I'm in as a woman and in terms of taking up space and having a voice.  Going to a women's college, you learn a lot about that, and you lose a lot of the – a lot of what I feel like I learned growing up gets rewired being in that kind of space, which is very cool.  I take that with me, even though it's not my alma mater.  I think I learned so much about being with other very smart women.  


I’m thinking.  I think one of the things I really liked about aquaculture, and the reason that I came back to it, was that I – bless you.  I'll start that over. (laughter) Sound bites.  One of the things that I really loved about the aquaculture space, was that I was meeting a lot of really smart, really cool, very dynamic women.  I kind of already touched on this, but in terms of what I want a career to look like, and I always say this – it's a lot more abstract than you think it is, following the traditional path here in the United States at least, that continues to narrow where you're going to go in your life and your career, from high school to college, and then college, you have to declare, and it's supposed to be funneling you towards something, which I actually think can end up closing you off from a lot of different things, which is counterintuitive because it’s supposed to create more experiences for you.  


I realized I had to zoom out to my experience and look at those things in terms of, do I like what I do?  Do other people like what they do?  Do I like them?  Things like that.  One of those things was, are there women in the space who seem to enjoy being here?  And the answer is yes.  Not to say that it's completely perfect.  I don't think any industry is, but I felt very much like I was surrounded by very powerful women who were engaging in work in the same way that men were in terms of there’s women-owned oyster farms and there's male-owned oyster farms.  The women-owned oyster farms are in the minority, but in terms of the work that's having to be done, it's pretty equal.  


I think there’s definitely work to still be done to address some of the disparities and barriers in that.  There’s other organizations that are addressing that.  Maine Sea Grant is doing a cohort of the aquaculture-insured waters course that's for women and non-binary folks, and they've been doing that all spring because there definitely is still disparities there.  But more so than other industries that I think I've looked at or I've heard from other female peers about that, I feel very much like I'm in good company of very smart and powerful women in aquaculture, and I think that's super cool.  I also hope that that's the kind of impact that I can have on other young women that I'm interacting with, is that they can see someone like me who's working in this role and loves what they do and can see themselves in that as well.


Q:        [45:57] Yeah, that's amazing.  Thank you.  I'm curious, as you look towards the future – this is an interesting question we've been asking – do you think that your role – how does that work with your thoughts towards the future of family or caregiving responsibilities, that sort of thing?


A:        [46:16] Yeah.  I think it's really, really hard.  I was thinking about this question an hour ago on the couch.  I was thinking about – because my partner has an oyster farm, and he also is a commercial clam digger, which means in the summer, I don't see him a lot and thinking about – we live together.  We share household duties.  But there are seasons of the year with his seasonal work that make it not sort of a 50/50 split.  Thinking about in terms of the expectations that we have on women in terms of domestic duties, if the roles were reversed and we were looking at starting a family, the kind of questions we would have to ask and the obstacles that we would then be facing.  I don't know. (laughter) 


I know there are, and I don't want to speak for her, but I feel like you probably will end up talking to her, but Joanna Fogg is – yeah.  She talks all the time about being out on her – I think she's had her farm for ten years, or she's been operating for ten years, and she talks about being out on her farm with her baby on her hip and nursing on the farm, and things that, I think, we can sort of glamorize or heroicize, and it is heroic.  Joanna is absolutely a hero, but that's also difficult.  It's something that men aren't expected to do, or that's not a picture that people have where the roles are reversed.  


I think one of the biggest things is actually, as the industry continues to grow, implementing those things.  How do you have maternity leave as a business owner?  If you own a farm and you are the only person working on the farm, how do you navigate that?  It’s something that, if you work for a company, they likely have a policy on it.  But small businesses often aren't able to absorb the impact of that in terms of cost, or you can't just step away from a farm and take maternity leave if you're the only one working on it.  


I think that is something that, if more people are getting into the industry, is going to have to be addressed.  But one thing I can say that I think actually addresses that issue, is that's where this question of scale comes in, in terms of – there's a lot of conversations around the scale of the industry.  What is large scale?  What is small scale?  Everything in Maine is minuscule scale compared to other aquaculture operations in the world.  Aquaculture in Asia is operating at a massive scale, and it's also been operating for way longer than we have.  So, it makes sense.  


But one thing that can happen with scale, in terms of a small farm that starts at a certain size and is able to grow, is that you would then have the resources to provide things like health benefits, and so people who can get pregnant and have children can consider working on a farm and not have to worry about that.  Either you have a policy in place – there is a maternity leave policy or paternity leave – or you know that can get proper insured medical care in a way that you might not be able to in starting your own farm.  That's something that I really like to stress to people because we love to see people starting farms, but it's important to have entry-level opportunities for people, especially as we're creating more job opportunities and recruiting more programs in terms of workforce development.  


We helped start with GMRI, the apprenticeship program, which is a 2000-hour position with 144 hours of coursework for folks to get really intensive aquaculture experience and then be able to launch into this industry with accreditation for this program and a ton of practice.  But in order to have those, you also then need to have every other level of the chain for people that are just starting out as a farmhand, maybe don't have a ton of experience, have some boat experience, and then can work their way up.  Having those be viable in terms of do they provide benefits, do they provide retirement plans – things that are really important when we talk about scale and are a huge necessity and benefit in terms of any industry being able to have equity across who's employed in it is having those structures and having farms or hatcheries or processing facilities that are operating at a scale that can provide health benefits and, by extension, things like maternity leave.  


Q:        [51:23] Great.  I'm going to quickly pause.  I need to change the batteries in this thing.  Switching gears a little bit, can you describe any environmental changes that either you've noticed working on the farm and now in this role or that people have sort of described having to you with aquaculture?  


A:        [51:39] Yeah, I think some things that we talk about are ocean acidification, warming waters obviously, warming waters leading to the introduction of new pathogens or species, and also, in general, catastrophic storms that are happening more and more frequently that are very difficult to prepare for in terms of protecting your gear or your product.  The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than any other body of water in the world, and so we are at the forefront of these changes and are having to adapt quicker than a lot of other places.  I've had growers who've reported higher shell breakage to me because of acidification, making the shells not as strong, which leads to a lower product in terms of on the raw market when your product is expected to be shucked in a raw bar, and it’s difficult to do that.  


Across fisheries and aquaculture, what we're seeing is a lot of change that's affecting us in different ways, and we have different abilities to adapt, but we all recognize that change is coming.  I think that because aquaculture is newer, we are possibly able to adapt faster because we're still in the ball of clay stage, and so it's easier to absorb if we are innovating and also inventing, but for industries that have been around for a really long time, sometimes adapting in that way is really hard.  I am trying to think of – the storms were a great example of no matter who you are, if you have anything on the water, it's liable to get damaged by that or completely swept away by that.  I think our working waterfronts are being universally affected by all of these different changes.


Q:        [54:02] Yeah.  Can you talk a little bit more about the adaptation, things people are trying as they sort of look towards the future?


A:        [54:08] Yeah.  I think because it goes in line with a lot of the talking points around aquaculture, in terms of improving an environment that it's in or providing food in a sustainable way, a lot of farmers are looking at things like solar processing.  The farm that I worked on uses 100% solar processing for their tumbling of oysters with a solar array on their float.  There's a lot of boat electrification conversations happening, and resources being directed to develop that and do research around it.  I've heard conversations of how shellfish are the canary in the coal mine in terms of changing environmental conditions in the water, and that includes wild harvesters and farmers who are noticing a lot of those changes sooner than maybe other species or other people working on the water.  


It really depends on your ability to –and often, that has to do with can you afford to adapt.  Things like solar panels are expensive.  Electric boats are incredibly expensive.  Biodegradable bags are probably going to cost more than a cheap plastic bag.  But a lot of growers that I know are transitioning to that because it's important to them, and their impact on the environment is a higher priority than saving a few dollars here and there in terms of biodegradable oyster shellfish bags versus the traditional plastic.  A lot of farmers are making that added investment to further their greater mission outside of their small business, mitigating their impact on the environment.  I think if you're growing something in the water that changes in the environment affect you also don't want to contribute to them.  It may not have – it's not a one to one, but I know that that is definitely a priority with a lot of growers.


Q:        [56:18] Sure.  As you look towards the future as these changes are getting made, do you think they're really going to help the industry move into the future?


A:        [56:28] I think so.  I think they have to be tested in terms of commercial viability.  Everything does at some point.  Can an electric boat move six cages worth of product at a reasonable speed from the line to the float?  Can this amount of solar array support tumbling this many oysters for eight hours straight?  Or whatever it is.  I think that the more people who adopt these or – a lot of it's volunteer in terms of, we have this new technology, would anyone like to try it out?  We'll install it for you or something – that is really important, and people are really embracing their opportunities to do that, especially where there's low cost or no cost.  That's where the people who are leading the technology can work with the growers, and the growers give them an opportunity to test it out in a way that maybe this lab or this engineering company wouldn't have had the opportunity to.  We do have to all work together to figure out what solutions make sense.  


I thought about this.  I think that in terms of – speaking from an aquaculture perspective, conversations around mitigating climate change or working to improve the environment or lessen impact on the environment, what kind of goes unsaid, I feel like, is that aquaculture itself is one of those tools.  Whether you're putting in a solar array or transitioning to an electric outboard, there's also, as we're seeing, lobstermen who are diversifying their income with kelp farming, which has a similar impact in terms of denitrification of the water and de-acidification of the water that the kelp is grown in, as well as added income in a really slow time for lobstermen.  That can have the same effect as utilizing solar energy in terms of mitigating impact on the environment in a way that makes sense for your business and can also help your business.  


That's what I think sometimes gets lost is that in conversations around wild harvest and farming, sometimes it's wild harvest versus farming.  Really, aquaculture is a technology that everybody can use the best – some of the best sea farmers are fishermen because they have this experience on the water, they have the respect for the water, and working on the water is a generational practice for them.  When it comes to kelp farming, lobstermen have the infrastructure that someone who was like, “I just want to start kelp farming,” will not have.  They have the expensive boat, and they have the hauler, and that period of the year is not occupied by fishing.  


So, yeah, I don't really know how I want to say this, but I think we can utilize aquaculture in the same way that we utilize a lot of other types of renewable energy or single-use plastic replacement.  That's an addition to your business or an extension of what you do on the water that can have a similar kind of positive impact for you and can actually also make you money.  A solar panel doesn't necessarily make you money, but pulling kelp out of the water in the spring gives you money to buy bait, hire people, and start the season with cash rather than starting the season with no cash.  


Q:        [1:00:39] Yeah, absolutely.  I'm curious.  You talked about low-cost or no-cost things that might be available to people who want to try out new stuff.  Can you talk a little bit more about that and how those things happen?


A:        [1:00:48] Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of grants that are available for people to – I’m trying to think about what this is.  There's grants available for people to take advantage of things like renewable energy.  I don't know if that's – I won't say that.  There's just a lot of money that I think is available in grants to take advantage of a lot of the innovation that's happening so that small farms can test drive a lot of this equipment, and the people who created the equipment can learn about it because changing your operations in favor of more renewable energy sources is expensive.  In a state of a lot of small farms – majority small farms – vast majority – that needs to be a realistic option for people.  So, whether it's through the state investing money in it or big grant agencies to have large endowments dedicating that money to have low barrier for people to take advantage of it, I think, is something that is happening in Maine and is growing.  


I can't think of any specific – I don't know if I'm supposed to mention names or not, but places like the Island Institute work towards that and making it affordable or using – I also work for an organization where we have more resources than one farm might have, and so we try to execute the same things in terms of – and then distributing them to other people because one farm on their own isn't going to be able to take advantage of that.  That's where we see money is really important.  It's one thing to want to have a positive impact on the environment.  It's another thing to be able to do that.  I think it's a mix of growing to a scale where you can afford to make those choices between a single-use plastic and a biodegradable and then also having it be a priority for the town that you live in or the state of Maine at large to fund or subsidize those kinds of programs, or addition of technology, or anything like that.


Q:        [1:03:25] In addition to the money it takes, what else do you think is really important for people in aquaculture to adapt?  What else do you think they need as they look towards that?


A:        [1:03:42] I just did a whole long class or two days of intensive training on this.  But one thing that's – are you asking specifically in terms of environmental impact, or just for the industry? 


Q:        [1:03:56] Both or yes.  You know what I mean?  I'm really interested in all of those things, really looking toward the future.


A:        [1:04:08] I’m trying to think how I want to say this.  Not that it's bad.  In order for – I always say this.  In order for the aquaculture industry to succeed in Maine, it needs to succeed in the most authentically Maine way possible, which is through support from the fisheries, through investment by the state, and through its recognition as part of the working waterfront.  Outside of the financial side of it, outside of the environmental side of it, the social aspect is really, really, really important, and that's mostly what I do, is working with this concept of social license, which is a social license to operate, which means you have endorsement and support from the community that you're working in.  It's one thing to go through the leasing process and get the signature on paper.  It's another thing to have to work in a town that really values your presence.  


We're running up against a battle for that in Maine right now, and it's from a variety of factors.  It's coming from gentrification of the working waterfront, where there are people coming in who don't have a realistic expectation of what a working waterfront is and expect Maine waterfronts to be like a postcard, silent and serene, and they are not that.  There’s rare pockets where that is true, but a lot of that has come about through the erasure of active and functional working waterfronts.  I don't know that I would call it a cultural rift, but there is a difference of priorities in terms of what is happening in coastal communities.  


For aquaculture or wild fisheries to continue to be strong industries, they need to be valued, and they need to be acknowledged as an essential part of Maine's culture, heritage and economy, which it is.  The Maine seafood brand is so strong, and that includes aquaculture, and it's a relatively new industry, but there's a lot of work that has to be done on the individual level with farmers in one town and then also at the state-wide level to ensure that we're not creating division where there doesn't need to be.  One of those places is the push and pull between industry, and I don't know if I would say recreation or residency, in terms of who lives where and who works where and where those overlap, which they invariably do in working waterfront communities, and also in terms of shared interests.  


Water use is a really important conversation, and there are a bunch of different interests on the water in terms of whether you're a sailor, you're a sport fisherman, you're a commercial fisherman, or you're a farmer.  We all have to share the water, and there's a lot of social groundwork that goes into making sure that that is a harmonious balance and not a hostile one.  I do a lot of work to kind of remind people that aquaculture is and can be a part of working waterfronts.  It by no means replaces fishing, and it's not meant to.  Culturally, fishing and sea farming are different, and not every fisherman is going to want to become a sea farmer, and that is well within their right to not do that.  


What we try to do is demonstrate that aquaculture is available to people, and it's something that they can take advantage of if they feel so inclined to do that, and it isn't something that is meant to push out or replace or antagonize or diminish any other existing water use.  You can see that in terms of the leasing guidelines, where aquaculture is the lowest priority.  You have to establish that any farm that you are going to put in does not interfere with fishing, fouling, navigation, recreation, to and from access from docks and piers.  I think the narrative is different, or the narrative around it is that aquaculture will come in and take over spaces, and you can own the water, which is just not the case.  Sometimes, that comes about through not having the right conversations.  It often comes down to you talking to your neighbor if you are proposing a lease and doing that social license work.  


I think that’s what's really cool about the Maine aquaculture space is how it’s still so grassroots.  You have to go and knock on the door of this person.  I think that's a great thing in terms of keeping it familiar.  We’re not in the way of this idea that people have of corporations.  It's this faceless thing that is going to come and either pollute our waterways or take up or rip out trees and build giant buildings or whatever it is.  It's someone whose kids probably go to school with your kids, and you see them at the farmers market, and that process really humanizes the development of aquaculture and requires there to be this interaction between a farmer and the community that they're going to be in, which isn't something that's required of other industries and can sometimes be burdensome.  There’s some people who will never want to support your operation, but it does require you to come and have a face-to-face conversation, which I think is really valuable.  Yeah, I feel like I'm all over the place.


Q:        [1:11:23] No, it's awesome.  


A:        [1:11:24] Yeah, I just don't really know how to communicate it because I don't want to contribute to this idea that there is division because there actually is less division than I think people think that there is. (Redacted). But if you have a consumer who gets fed information about farmed this versus wild that, they're going to apply it to what's relevant to them, and it'll be in a conversation about a farm that's going in in their town and the fishermen that are in their town.  So much of my job is that, is helping tell the story that we have so much more in common than we do difference.  In the same way that the aquaculture community collaborates to pool funds, resources, and time to accomplish these goals, fishing and farming can overlap in that same way, but not if a different story is being told.  You can destroy the part about the…(redacted)...(laughter), but it is true.  A lot of what people glean of bad things about farming come from campaigns that want you to stop eating seafood altogether, (laughter) so it’s not really relevant.  


Q:        [1:12:53] Do you want all of that taken out?


A:        [1:12:55] I don't know.  I think there was a last bit in there that was good.


Q:        [1:13:00] I think it was good, but you can think about it and let me know.  Also, you don’t have to let me know right now.  No, I think that's awesome.  I'm curious, with all of this, I feel like what you're really expressing in a really clear and amazing way is how complicated it is.  It's so nuanced and specific.  I'm curious.  As you look toward the future, what do you think is your biggest priority for the success of aquaculture?  Maybe a different way to rethink that is if you were to tell a policymaker or someone, what do you really think is the thing to bring forward with all of those really complicated and nuanced thoughts in mind?


A:        [1:13:35] Yeah, I think one of the things is that in terms of water use, inevitably comes this idea of competing for water use, which is true, and that happens everywhere.  I think if we're able to view successes of the aquaculture industry – if we are able to view successes of the aquaculture industry not as coming at the expense of other industries, we will have a way more holistic idea of its contributions to Maine's economy, opportunities for means young workforce – aquaculture is one of the – and from speaking to a lot of young people, there's many young people who want green jobs, and coming from a state where it's always been the narrative that you have to leave in order to succeed, and everyone that I have been around who grew up in Maine as a young person had that idea of when I get out of here, and I'm going to have to get out of here to do this – that's changing.  Aquaculture is one of those reasons because it's a green job that is a growing industry, not a dying industry, and there's a lot of opportunity there.  


I think that that's amazing, but not if that is stymied through social conflict or financial conflict or anything like that.  I'm really grateful to have a job in aquaculture, and I hope that there's tons of other jobs like mine that become available.  But the industry has to grow in order for that to be the case.  I think a lot of it is just like – it's hard to think about it at the state level in terms of legislative change or legislative priority.  I think, honestly, one of the biggest legislative priorities is to just give money to working waterfronts.  There's this huge bill passed, like fifty million that is going to working waterfront restoration.  But I think that money can only be used to build back to the level or build back to what was pre-existing, not build back better.  So, there needs to be money to ensure these access points, which are used by farmers and fishermen alike, can withstand the next storm.  Not we built it, and the wood is newer, but it's still at the same level, and if you want to build it higher, you have to pay for that with your town funds, which Brunswick is going to have more than other towns Downeast.  


It also, I feel like, is unifying.  It's not for one industry or the other.  Working waterfronts are where both industries unite, and I think that aquaculture and fishing have a lot more in common, actually, because they both keep working waterfronts active, and I think having farms in an area brings more money to piers and landings, and working waterfront access points and also, aquaculture can be a force to counter gentrification in terms of if a harbor is able to become a place with only sailboats and no lobster pots and no boats and no cages, then that's basically the erasure of the working waterfront.  But if you have farms in a town where people can make money working on the water and possibly also afford to live in that town, that counters the gentrification that can then happen there and keeps it from becoming, no offense, a retirement community.  I love that people come to Maine to retire, but Maine also needs to be able to be a working community.  That doesn't make any sense.  I don't know.  I don't know how to – I don't know why.  I’m usually so good at articulating this.  It might be the microphone, but I'm trying to think about how to say all it is that I have to say at once.  


Q:        [1:18:19] No, I think that was really articulate, honestly.  I think that was a really great way of describing – I feel like I really understand what you're saying.  


A:        [1:18:26] Yeah.  You don't have to include this.  This could possibly be destroyed.  (Redacted). 


That's really hard because it's totally predatory in terms of you have a really vulnerable population of people who have been told for 20 years that climate change is coming and there's nothing you can do about it, and green crabs are coming, and there's nothing you can do about it, and they're extremely vulnerable and scared and for very good reason, in terms of this is your livelihood, and the only way that you can make money, you haven't had any other career, you might not have a college education, and you are being told that, on top of all of that, this person's farm is going to consume all of the available larvae in an area and kill off the clam flat. (Redacted).  I don't know how to say that without saying it.


It's funny because I don't make any money telling people the great story of aquaculture and why aquaculture should be – maybe it makes our members money, but it also makes people who don't pay dues to us money because their businesses are able to succeed.  (Redacted). It's unfortunate, and we try to do work on the ground to interact with fishermen, and there are fishermen who've completely embraced aquaculture, or fishermen who are in communities that the conversations around aquaculture are pretty negative, but they're having these inklings of like, “Well, if I was able to get a lease and do this, then I know that I could provide for my family in this way, or afford bait for this upcoming season,” or whatever it is.  I think, unfortunately, some of the things – and you can destroy up until – well, actually, I don't know.


Q:        [1:21:56] I have an idea, which is, I think it may be useful for me after this – and I wouldn't be able to do it immediately, but I could send you these in text, and you could selectively – 


A:        [1:22:07] Redact?


Q:        [1:22:08] – redact.  What will end up happening is that this will actually be edited.  The tape will probably be gone.  You couldn't legally be searched for it even.  I can send you chunks of it and then any edits you want to provide – because I think it's great stuff, and I think we could cut the name, and it could still be relevant.  If you feel good about that, we can address that as you need.  I don’t know how (inaudible) –


A:        [1:22:33] Whether it gets included or not, it's relevant to what you guys are doing.  I don't know if anyone else would bring it up, but we're in constant conversation about it because it's so unfortunate.  What we've determined is that it's not even that the fishermen necessarily feel this way.  It's that they're helpless.  If you say, climate change is coming.  You can't do anything.  Green crabs are coming.  You can't do anything.  Milky ribbon worms are coming.  You can't do anything.  But here's a guy, and he's having his hearing on Thursday, and you can show up and express your frustration, then it's like, yeah, I get it.  I get why people would do that.  It's frustrating.  Thankfully, it's not statewide.  It's these little pockets, mostly of clamming communities, …(redacted)... moratoriums which aren't actually effective against stopping aquaculture outside of the intertidal area and then sends them the bill.  (Redacted).  This is me venting now.  I don't want to over-complicate your process by doing this.  I feel like I'm dancing around it.


Q:        [1:23:55] I think it's really important information.


A:        [1:23:56] I want what I say to be real and not completely just Kumbaya.  


Q:        [1:24:01] No, I think it's so great.  You’re right.  We haven't heard about this.  I think we can talk more once this is off.  But whatever way feels best for you – I think there's a way for us to make this accessible to a wide audience and also not specific.  I think it is really important, and I’m really grateful for your sharing it with us and being open.  It’s really great.


A:        [1:24:23] Starting from here, I feel like I can say what I said without saying so much.  I think that often, there's conversations around division between fishing and aquaculture that – about conflicts of interests that aren't actually – I don't want to say that they aren't actually there because they're valid.  I think fishing and aquaculture have a lot more to gain from uniting than dividing, whether that's over the use of an area or delivery of state funds or resources in terms of prioritizing one industry over the other.  We all have a lot to gain from prioritizing the seafood economy, the working waterfront economy, and jobs for young people.  I think what's exciting is that there's a lot of opportunity for people who fish to get into aquaculture, and whether they choose to or not, it's completely up to them, but we like to show that that technology is available.  


Right now, it takes a really long time to get a farm.  It's three to five years in order to even start operating on a lease site.  But fishermen can take advantage of the same leasing capabilities and opportunities as people who aren't coming from the fishing community and for whatever way that makes sense to them.  If it's coming from someone who's a wild shellfish harvester who wants to do oyster farming, that's awesome, or lobstermen doing kelp.  I think it's demonstrative of how adaptable Mainers are, and how adaptable Mainers who work on the water are.  Aquaculture is yet another opportunity to adapt in the face of really big, scary hurdles that Maine is feeling and hurting from more than any other space.  


I think people are afraid of change, and people are afraid of things that are new to them.  But I'm here to tell people that aquaculture is not scary, and it's often an opportunity for you to learn a different way of working on the water without having to lose that really important part of your identity.  If you're someone who's been fishing for – your family's been fishing for seven generations, and you're faced or confronted with declining populations or higher cost of bait and fuel, which is making it cost-prohibitive to go out and fish, or you're having to go further out to catch what you should be able to catch more inshore.  Aquaculture is kind of an opportunity to adapt to face a lot of those challenges.  We just try to demonstrate that, rather than having any division in terms of who's a farmer, who's a sea farmer, who gets to be a sea farmer, what's their identity or background or capital backing, or anything like that.  


Q:        [1:27:23] I think that's so fantastic.  Thank you.  


A:        [1:27:25] That was a nicer way of saying all that.


Q:        [1:27:37] Thank you for being so generous with that response.  Really, it's awesome.  I'm curious, can you talk about positive changes because I think there must be some.  Right?  Can you talk about what that looks like?


A:        [1:27:46] Yeah.  I think the adoption of lobstermen, specifically in Casco Bay, growing kelp has been incredible.  I was out on a legislative tour on Monday with some municipal representatives and state representatives in Casco Bay, checking out some of the kelp farms that are there who are partner farmers of Atlantic Sea Farms.  These are people who've been fishing for forever, and they have boats with haulers that are perfectly suited for growing kelp.  And they love it.  I think that even outside of kelp’s environmental benefits, and that it is a source of protein and so many different types of vitamins and minerals, and it doesn't require any fertilizer or any freshwater, it’s a paycheck at the start of the summer.  For many, that's what's most important, and that's fine.  There doesn't need to be necessarily a pious mission behind everyone's aquaculture ventures.  


The point is that it's supposed to be a viable industry, and kelp farming is for a lot of fishermen at a certain scale.  Getting a paycheck at a time when you wouldn't normally expect one is a massive deal for a lot of people's businesses.  I think that's been entirely positive, and it's also being introduced through a community that is very well known, is a central part of Maine's identity, and is generally trusted as knowledgeable about the water and what the water should be used for.  You can't really argue with that.  This idea there has to always be conflict between farmed farming and wild harvester fishing is that it doesn't have to be the case.  And here's prime examples of where it's been embraced.  I think there's other examples, too, but I think that's one of the strongest ones, primarily because they're completely opposite seasons, so it makes sense.  It might not make sense for someone who harvests clams to also have an oyster farm because they're both summer endeavors. 


Q:        [1:30:18] I'm curious if you noticed any difference in women's participation or status in aquaculture.


A:        [1:30:29] I feel like I haven't been around long enough to notice necessarily a change, but at least in the communication space, everyone that I work with who holds a similar role at other organizations as a woman, pretty much, and that is very cool to see because we are the primary storytellers for the industry, and I think women are really good at that.  I don't really know why, but I think it's just like – I don't know if it's – and you can destroy this, too.  Yeah, I don't know.  (Redacted). In terms of being able to look at all these different pieces is very good for communications.  


I think right now, honestly, it's difficult to answer a question in terms of, am I seeing more women coming into the industry or new farmers starting their own farms because of the backlog of lease applications, that regardless of gender, everyone is struggling with waiting to get a farm.  I don't know, in terms of the new applicants compared to old applicants or how many applicants there were five years ago.  How many of those were women?  I think overall, it has increased.  It's increased overall.  But because of the backlog of applications, no one, regardless of gender, is able to get into the industry very quickly.  


I do see a lot of – I see a lot more women as farm hands than women as farm owners, through just a basic rattling off the list in my head of who's working on farms.  But when we host any kind of social event, I would say it's probably 50/50.  I just hosted an aquaculture social in Wiscasset because all of the aquaculture social events always happen in Portland, and no one from Mid-Coast comes, even though that is the birthplace of oyster farming and some of the big farms there that are really doing it right, are there, and it's a pretty even mix of people in the room of men and women.  But who is holding the power of those people is different.  Yeah, I don't know.  


I don't know what it would look like if everyone who wanted to have a farm could have one tomorrow and what the gender makeup of that would be.  Like we were kind of talking about, if you are of a certain age and thinking about having a kid, and then also thinking about starting a farm, that is a big conversation to have with yourself, or with your spouse or whoever, about that and then the expectation of having a huge life shift in the middle of trying to grow business is a really valid concern to have and something that I imagine would cause a lot of people to not want to pursue a massive investment like that, if they knew that was something that they also wanted that might be in conflict with the ability to run that business.  Make sense?


Q:        [1:33:59] Yes, absolutely, it does.  And my last big question, I guess, is, what is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's waterfront?  What do you really hope that looks like?


A:        [1:34:12] Yeah, I don't know if it'll happen, but I really hope that everyone who works on the water is able to live within a reasonable distance from the water.  What I hope to see is a better appreciation and understanding of how aquaculture fits into the use of Maine's oceans, and we're able to go off of the data and the facts that support its value to Maine over some of the – I don't know.  We run up against a lot of NIMBY-ism, not in my backyard, which is hard to weigh against – which is hard when that voice is just as loud, if not louder, than someone who says, “I'm trying to start a business and be successful in a career where I am my own boss.”  They're just not the same.  There are some people who would say that protecting someone's property value is more valuable than making money because that's some kind of greedy endeavor that you have because you are money-motivated, which is just frustrating.  


I don't know what I want it to look like.  I don't know what I want.  I think I want to see a bunch of fishermen who are also farming and also still fishing.  I don't want there to be a mono industry in the way that we kind of see now with lobster.  There's other Maine seafood, but lobster is dominant, vastly, vastly dominant, which only makes it more precarious.  We used to have ground fishing.  We used to have canneries, and now we have this one sort of mono catch.  I think for Maine to return to the diversity of species and seafood would be incredible.  I think it would be so awesome.  I could totally see it happening in terms of – we have these defunct canneries up and down the coast that could be easily bought, rebuilt, and then used to land an increasing tonnage of species, farmed or wild, to meet growing demand in the rest of the country.  I think that's what I also – I think what I would see is that Maine is – we need to ramp up aquaculture operations because the whole world suddenly wants to eat kelp, and the whole world suddenly wants to eat smoked oysters and things like that.  That would be awesome.  


I don't know if Maine can solve the demand issue.  We can work on it, but what I really hope is that there comes this recognition of the opportunity that aquaculture has to put Maine on the map.  Maine's already on the map in terms of, we're leading the country in marine aquaculture, but where it's a no-brainer to kind of get into this industry because there's a market for it.  You can be successful, you can hire people, and you can operate at a scale that makes sense for you and your workforce.  It has nothing to do with whether you're a fisherman or whether you're a farmer.  It's just food production in a really fulfilling way that makes a difference.  I don't know how we get there, but I think that there's some mending that needs to be done before we get there and some groundwork that needs to be laid where sort of tensions have arisen to remind everybody what we could be working towards.


Q:        [1:38:31] Great.  Thank you so much.  Is there anything else you want to bring up before we end the interview?  


A:        [1:38:40] No.  It's not something that I would say, but I'm so interested to see what other women from fishing have to say because they have a way better perspective than I do.  I am not qualified to speak on fishing.  I can speak from what I've been exposed to through aquaculture.  I think that actually might be even important to say.  I do not have enough fishing background to accurately speak on the fishing industry, but what I can speak to is the fishermen who have engaged in aquaculture, expressed interest in aquaculture, or even argued with me about aquaculture, and the conversations that we've had that have demonstrated a lot of common interest, also a lot of common anxiety in terms of affording living in waterfront communities, what our children are going to do when they're entering the workforce, and what opportunities are available there, what the world looks like when that's happening, what Maine's water looks like, who is underwater, and really getting at the root of where do some of these difficult conversations come from.  Why are we arguing?  Where are we arguing when we could easily be working towards something and putting in joint applications for a grant that would help?  


What's happening in Brunswick right now is the Marine Resources Committee and the commercial harvesters worked together to get a grant – I don't know if this is true, so don't put this in… (redacted). Upwellers are aquaculture.  A lot of the conversations where there's tension are in wild harvest shellfish and farm shellfish when aquaculture is one of the best techniques or solutions to declining clam populations.  But it's not thought about that way.  


So, I think reworking that narrative and also just working together, which requires a lot of humility, a lot of patience, and a lot of putting aside of pride, which, like you said, Mainers are very prideful, and if we're all bringing pride into the room, we're not going to be productive.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think towns could do a better job of implementing aquaculture in their sort of – whether it's environmental planning or town planning – to support wild harvesters in their town and not have this viewpoint of wild harvest and farm being diametrically opposed.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't think I have anything else that I want to say.  


Q:        [1:41:52] Great.  Thanks so much.  Jess, do you have any questions before we –


A:        [1:41:55] No?


Q:        [1:41:56] No?  OK, great.  I'll go ahead and turn this off.


A:        [1:41:59] OK.


END OF FILE"
"4","Q:        [0:00] OK, if we could just start by telling me your name and how you spell it.


A:        [0:05] Sure.  Do you need me to get closer?  


Q:        [0:07] No, you’re perfect.


A:        [0:08] My name is Giulia Cardoso, and it's spelled G-I-U-L-I-A.  Last name is C-A-R-D-O-S-O.


Q:        [0:16] Great.  How do you like to introduce yourself?  


A:        [0:19] Well, my name is Giulia.  I'm a 30-year-old fisherman living in Bar Harbor, Maine.  I've been fishing for, I think, the last five years.  I kind of lost track, but I think it's been about five seasons.  I mostly fish for lobsters, but I also go halibut and scallop fishing.  I've been working on oyster farms and harvesting wild oysters of my own.  I started harvesting wild mussels as well recently.  I'm very, very passionate about direct sales.  So, a big part of what I do is selling directly to consumers through farmers' markets, restaurants, or just direct sales.  Hopefully, next year, I'll start fishing for green crabs, too, because I applied for a grant through the Maine Sea Grant to get some money to start doing that.  So, if you interview me a year from now, I might have that on top of everything else.  


Q:        [1:11] Great.  Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [1:14] Yeah, sure.  I grew up in Italy, actually, in a big city called Milan that has the same population of the state of Maine, but in one city.  It's a two and a half ride from the ocean, but my family was never really like a sea family.  I always tell people my dad's scared of swimming to give you an idea of how comfortable my family is on the water.  Yeah, I grew up there, had a very nice, sheltered upbringing, and when I turned eighteen, I went to London for college.  I was studying geography, and at the same time, I started scuba diving, which is what fueled my passion for the ocean.  At first, I was trying to find a way to scuba dive in a way that my parents wouldn't be angry at me for.  So, I started doing dive-based research.  


My first big project was looking at the invasive lionfish in Cuba.  Once in Cuba, we started tagging sharks, which completely deranged my passions and interests.  I started working with sharks for a little while there in the Bahamas and then on Cape Cod.  As I was doing that, I also realized that I was more interested in a type of conservation that had a more holistic approach and included humans in it.  That’s how I landed at COA to do my master's looking at the local lobster industry from, I guess, a human ecology perspective, I should say.  Once here, I started fishing as part of my research, and then I stuck with it.  Not sure if I actually answered your question, which was more about where I grew up. (laughter)


Q:        [2:57] Yeah, definitely.  What year were you born?  


A:        [2:58] ‘93


Q:        [3:00] ’93.  Where are your parents from?  And what did they do?  


A:        [3:03] Both my parents were born in Milan, Italy.  They both graduated with law degrees.  My mom worked as a lawyer for a few years, and then once my sister was born, she transitioned to being a stay-at-home mom, which was a lot for her because there were three of us, so definitely a full-time job.  Then my dad has worked in the pharmaceutical industry his pretty much entire life.


Q:        [3:28] Do you have any siblings?  


A:        [3:29] Yeah, I have an older sister who's two and a half years older than me.  She lives in London, works in TV and film production, and I have a younger brother, two years younger than me, who lives in Rome right now, I guess, and it's kind of unclear what he does, but kind of like a photographer/artist.


Q:        [3:48] Sure.  You've kind of answered this already, but do you have any history of fishing in your family?  


A:        [3:51] No, not at all. (laughter)  


Q:        [3:55] Then, we can move from that question.  Are you married?  


A:        [3:59] I am to my husband, Josh, who also happens to be my captain right now.  It's a lot of –


Q:        [4:08] Yeah.  How did you two meet?  


A:        [4:10] We actually met on the water.  It's kind of a cool story.  I was fishing with my first captain, and it was middle of May, beginning of June, so halibut season here in Maine, and it was my first year fish – well, it was my first season fishing full time.  I had started the fall before, just at the tail end of it, and I really wanted to go halibut fishing, so I asked Steve, my old captain, if he knew anybody that would take me.  He said, “Yeah, absolutely.  There's Josh Kane, super nice guy.  He'll take you.  No questions asked.”  I was like, “OK.”  


At that point, I had only met old-timers, so I thought Josh was going to be another 70-year-old man.  Then, the next day, we're steaming back in, and we see a boat on the horizon.  It's like, “Oh, look at that.  It's Josh.”  I’m like, “OK, cool.  Maybe I'll get to go halibut fishing tomorrow.”  Then we pull up, and Josh is not a 70-year-old man.  He's a man in his 30s, much better looking than I expected a 70-year-old fisherman to be.  He agreed to take me halibut fishing, and the next day, we went.  He caught a nice big fish, which I’m sure helped his success in catching me.  The rest is history, I guess.  We started fishing together about a year and a half later.  I did a full season with Steve and then another half a season, and then I quit and went fishing with Josh.


Q:        [5:25] Do you have any children?  


A:        [5:27] No, not yet.  I have two stepchildren, I should say, Wyatt, 19, and Kenna is 16, but of my own, no.


F1:        [5:35] Does your husband, Josh, have a history of fishing in his family?  


A:        [5:38] Kind of, but not really.  His dad was the chief firefighter here in Bar Harbor.  His mom worked at the bank.  Most of the older generation didn't fish, but pretty much all of his cousins and he went fishing because they grew up in the late ‘80s, early 90s, when the lobster fishing started to really boom.  So, by the time they were old enough to go working, that's what he wanted to be doing.  That's where the money was.  So, he is a first-generation fisherman.  I'm sure some of his uncles, at some point, jumped on a boat, but they weren't career fishermen.  Yeah, he started fishing when he was 16, went ground fishing for a little bit, and then transitioned to lobstering.  Like I said, most of his cousins, actually, all of his cousins still are fishermen or work on the water.


Q:        [6:27] And how would you describe your role in the fishing or aquaculture industry in Maine?


A:        [6:33] (laughter) I feel like I've explored a lot of different fields in that big field of fishing and aquaculture.  Because, like I said, I've been fishing for a few years now, and I've been very lucky to experience a lot of different fisheries, which is sort of unusual around here because lobstering really is the main source of income for most fishermen.  Josh kind of belongs to an old-school group of fishermen because he grew up around fishing, so he was exposed to that culture and that group of people.  He kind of retained a lot of that with him, and he's always looking for new opportunities.  He's not just a lobsterman, and it also means that he does things a little old school, so I got to see a lot of very cool things that I don't think happen that much anymore, like rigging very old boats to go scalloping in the middle of winter, or we have a federal permit to go fish for scallops down in Massachusetts in the spring.  So, we go do that and live on the boat.  It's been a lot of fun.  It's definitely been an adventure.  


I've been able to see most of the major fisheries in Maine because, like I said, I've been lobstering for four or five years, or whatever it is, and scalloping for three or four, and we go halibut fishing pretty much every year.  I feel like I have a pretty good pulse on what the fishing world looks like.  We also have a federal lobster permit, so we go offshore in the winter, so I get to do both summer and winter fishing.  


Then, in the last – well, actually, before I get there, pretty much since I started living in Maine, every winter, I picked up a little bit of work on aquaculture farms, partly due to my personal interest and partly due to the money that you need to survive.  That's been pretty interesting, too, because I've been able to work on two different oyster farms and one mussel farm.  I think that's it.  Yes.  So, I've seen very different styles of operation, both for the product being raised and the way that they raise it, because the two oyster farms I worked on use different methods.  I don't love aquaculture, to be honest.  I like that sense of adventure and like things changing every day that I feel like you get in fishing, but not as much in aquaculture.  We can talk more about that later because I'm sure you have more questions about aquaculture. (laughter) I've got a good – I feel like I have a good sense of, at least, how aquaculture farms operate here.  I obviously stayed friends with a lot of the people that I worked with, so I hear about market dynamics and all that.  


Then, last year, I started going oystering and musseling on my own, which was great.  It’s a low-entry easy-access fishery, both of them, because all you have to do is look at a tide chart and bring a basket with you and a measuring tool.  So, yeah, I'm starting to get involved in that, too, which I thought would have been like a walk in the park.  But of course, it's not always like that.  There's the Bar Harbor Marine Resources Committee is starting to talk about maybe regulating access to oysters differently, which might impact the way that I'm able to harvest them.  So, even with what I thought was going to be just a fun little thing to do on the side, now there's conversations and regulatory changes and work outside of the actual fishing that I'm probably going to have to put some time into.  Does that answer your question?  


Q:        [10:26] Yeah.  Can you talk to me a little bit more about what you'd like to do with green crabs?


A:        [10:29] Yeah, of course.  I'm very excited about that, actually.  I'll go the long way around if that's okay.  Both Josh and I want to look for a new crew for his boat.  We work really well together, and it's been great for us to get the business started in the last few years, but realistically speaking, his traps are too big for me, and he wants to go fishing a little harder than I want to and having two people from the same household on the same boat at all times just doesn't work when you have a home life and pets and things to take care of.  Basically, because of that, I'm going to step off the boat, but I really don't want to stop fishing because I really like being on the water.  It's how I've always really made a living.  I also don't really want to have another captain because I'm a little over being bossed around and not being able to set my schedule.  


I'm one of those people that has a million projects going at the same time, so I really value being able to say, “Oh, I don't want to work today.  I'm not going to because I have these other things to do.”  I get that flexibility with Josh, but not really.  I'm his crew.  He treats me as his crew.  So, if we need to go fishing, we're going fishing.  Anyway, going out on my own seemed like the perfect solution to keep my time and my independence and also keep staying on the water.  Because, as you know, access to fisheries is very strict in Maine, actually the easiest thing that I could do was going green crab fishing because it's an invasive species.  There's not really any regulations.  It's an open-access fishery.  


On top of that, I've always been interested in invasive species.  Like I said earlier, my first big piece of work was on invasive lionfish.  I think it's a great resource that's there and it's untapped.  I'm excited about the work that I'm going to be doing, which involves not only catching them and figuring out how to catch them, which I don't think will be hard.  I think the harder part will be selling them because there's not much of a market in the States.  


As an Italian, to me, this is crazy because you have good food right on your doorstep, and just because you've never seen it before doesn't mean that it's not a viable option for you.  I'm actually kind of excited to talk with people, and – I don't want to say teach them how to eat green crabs because that sounds a little patronizing, but just share some information with them.  We work with a few restaurants in town through our lobstering business that have said they're interested in buying green crabs.  I'm pretty excited about that.  That gives me an outlet that I'm more sure about than selling to people and trying to convince them to buy it.  


Then, I'm also going to turn them into compost because I'm looking for other viable alternatives.  Just because you're fishing for something doesn't mean it has to end up on somebody's table.  In a way, they would still end up on somebody's table through the compost.  So, I think that's pretty cool.  I'm really trying to – and I wrote this into the grant.  I'm really trying to basically show people that fishermen do more than just go out and hang out on the water and make a lot of money because none of that is actually true, down to the money part.  I think there's a lack of awareness about how much we're part of the food system, and we're part of the food systems in ways others then – “Oh, I'm bringing lobster on your table.”  Creating compost is a pretty cool thing.  You can go to Salisbury Farms and buy bags of compost for a premium price, and they're going to have lobster shells and crab shells in it.  So, there's no reason why I can do the same thing in my own backyard, basically.  


So, that's the plan.  I'm going to catch the green crabs.  I'm going to keep most of the volume for composting.  I'm going to sell some to restaurants for direct sale.  For restaurants and for direct sales, I want to differentiate between soft-shell and hard-shell crabs.  When the green crabs are molting – when they've just molted, you can cook them up like you would a blue crab, so the whole the whole animal.  That's actually how they're eaten in Italy.  They're a delicacy over in Venice.  I was kind of excited.  We went to Venice.  I was hoping to get to meet fishermen, but we were only there for two days, so no such luck.  That involves a little bit of extra work because you have to monitor the crabs.  You have to figure out how to tell when they’re about to molt, and then you have to isolate them in individual cages, let them molt, and monitor them as often as you can so that you can take them out of the water as soon as they molted and not let the shell harden.  That only happens twice a year during their seasonal molts, which I think is May, June, and then, September, October.  


I remember last year I was oystering.  I started oystering in July, so it was after the first molt, but even into October, I remember finding – because you see a lot of green crabs out on the flats.  I remember finding a lot of softies.  So, it goes further into the fall than I thought, which probably ties well back into the questions that you're going to have about climate change because, obviously, it's all temperature-dependent.  Twice in the season, I'm going to be doing that, and then the rest of the time, on their hard shell, I just sell them to make broth or to pick the meat or whatever people can come up with.


Q:        [16:08] Great.  Thank you.  Can you talk a little bit about how you got into fishing here?


A:        [16:13] Yeah.  When I first moved to Maine, I wanted to look at changes in the lobster fishery.  It was a very generic idea that I had for my masters.  Once I got here and I started reading Lobster Gangs of Maine, I became really interested in the territoriality aspect of it, and I decided to do my thesis on that.  I always knew I wanted to interview fishermen.  I wanted it to be a ground-up research project, as opposed to looking at numbers or stuff like that.  So, the next step was to realize that fishermen around here don't love researchers and don't love certain institutions more than others.  I knew that to really be able to interview them about a sensitive topic like territoriality, which sometimes involves illegal behaviors or behaviors that are generally not understood by the wider population, I really needed to build a trusting relationship with fishermen.  The best thing that I could come up with was to go fishing, which actually worked perfectly for me because I wanted to go fishing anyway.  I wanted to be out on the water.  It was kind of a win-win situation.  


Then, it was really just a stroke of luck.  I was taking a documentary class, and I decided to do a project on a fisherman.  It wasn't totally random.  I was trying to find ways of meeting fishermen, and this seemed like a good opportunity.  Somebody put me in contact with Steve Burns, who's an old timer here in Bar Harbor, who's been known to take women as his crew for a long time.  It just so happened that his crew was getting done, and I jokingly said, “I'll come fishing with you.”  He said, “OK.”  I had no experience.  I'd never been commercial fishing before.  But he clearly didn't care.  


So, I actually started with him that fall.  I started going with him and his then crew to take up traps.  It was a kind of – I don't know if you say this in English – a baptism of fire.  That’s what we say in Italy, yeah.  Because it was November, there was snow on the ground, and it was cold.  Looking back now, we weren't doing anything that crazy.  Ever since then, I've had way harder fishing days.  But for that to be my introduction to fishing, it was quite something.  But clearly, it worked out because I stuck with it.  That's how I started fishing.  His crew got done at the end of the year, and then Steve and I worked on his boat the whole winter to do maintenance.  I don't even remember what we did, but I learned a lot.  Then we started doing gear work in April/May, and come end of May/beginning of June, we started setting traps out, and that's how I started fishing.


Q:        [19:10] Great.  And what commercial licenses do you hold or have held?  


A:        [19:15] I have a commercial shellfish license, which allows me to harvest mussels and oysters.  I've held the town of Bar Harbor clam license.  I've never actually used it, but I had that for one year.  I had a green crab license this year, which I'm obviously going to renew.  I might be wrong, and the mussel license might be a separate one.  I'm just saying this in case NOAA then tracks me down for harvesting without the right license.  I have the lobster apprentice license, which technically counts as a commercial license, but it doesn't allow me to land any product.  It's just to be registered in the apprenticeship program, and I think that's it.  Oh, and a halibut license, of course.  Sorry, yes, halibut license.


Q:        [20:04] Do you have any experience in the industry beyond directly fishing or harvesting itself?  For instance, in bookkeeping, bait, or gear preparation?  


A:        [20:13] Yes, I do all the bookkeeping for me and my husband, like a typical fisherman's wife, and that's been a learning curve for me because I had never done any bookkeeping before.  I am not good with numbers, and it's also infuriating because Josh can do his bookkeeping in his mind.  He knows down to every cent what we have or doesn't have in the bank account.  I don't understand how he does it so easily, but then the actual bulk of the work is on me, which is fine.  It was kind of the agreement that I take care of it.  


Yeah, I do all that, and definitely the bait part of it because I've always gone around with whatever captain I was working for to get the bait.  I've never actually harvested bait, but that's another one of those projects that I'd like to get on this summer.  I'd like to get some pogies.  You can get a personal use license, and there's different ways that you can catch them.  I think I'm going to use a net, kind of like a fish trap system, and try and catch a few pogies, both for myself, for the green crabs, or for Josh, for lobsters.  So, either way, would stay in the family.  But yeah, definitely sourcing bait.  I've been all over the state.  Josh and I like to buy bait in bulk.  It saves us money and time, so we often go down to Rockland, to O'Hara, and buy bait directly from them.  So, a lot of time spent on Route 1 with a lot of barrels.  


Then there's the whole like dealing with the bait aspect of it that I never thought when I got into fishing.  If you fish out of a wharf or a co-op, it's kind of like a supermarket.  You show up, and they load you up with bait.  You might have to bait it out, but the really heavy lifting is done for you.  Where Josh and I are independent, and we're just starting out – because Josh got his license three years ago, now four years ago – we don't have all the resources that more established fishermen have.  We don't have a nice forklift to unload the bait off the truck, which means a lot of dumping the barrels into other barrels or other less-than-pleasant ways of moving a lot of bait.  I can tell you everything you want about bait, honestly.  


And then gear work, yes.  I've done a lot of gear work.  I've always got traps ready, both with Steve and Josh.  In the last year or so, Josh was a little more independent with gear work.  I probably only helped him 25% of the time because we also have a house to run.  Gear work is one thing that he really enjoys doing, and he often does it during the winter, so he's not rushing at the end of the season to get everything ready.  Well, at the beginning of the season, I should say.  


Then, the really cool gear work I've done is rigging the boat for scalloping.  So for one, two, three years, yeah, three out of the – yeah, for the last three years, pretty much Josh and I have on our own turned our boat from a lobstering boat to a scalloping boat.  That involves putting up the mast and the boom and installing the winch on deck.  And obviously, you can't just put these things on deck.  You have to figure out distances, is the boat going to be balanced, and all this stuff.  And that's Josh's work as the captain to do the brain work, but I've been there.  I've done a lot of stupid stuff that I wish we hadn't done.  Last year, we got a new winch, and we had to move the wire from one winch to the other.  I can't remember exactly why, but the only way we could do it was by hand, and this is like half-inch metal wire.  It's not rope.  So, a lot of pulling and winding and spooling on the winch and then getting the winch on the trailer with no forklift.  So, yeah, a lot of (inaudible) and pulling with ropes.  


I can also tell you all about how to rig a rope for scalloping.  It's been cool.  I've learned a lot of things.  I've learned how to – I came from a very sheltered environment, growing up in a big city with white-collar parents, so I had no mechanical knowledge.  I barely even understood how that stuff worked.  And now, I can diagnose simple problems.  I've run fuel lines.  I've run hydraulic lines.  Josh has been great in this sense.  He's always treated me like his crew to a fault, almost.  But now I feel way more confident going out on a boat on my own, fishing for green crabs, even if I'll be inside of land the whole time.  If anything happens, I feel like I wouldn't just be totally lost.  I would at least be able not to panic, I guess.


Q:        [25:10] Do you have any experience in post-harvest processing, marketing, or trade?  


A:        [25:14] Yes, (laughter) because we do all these direct sales.  Well, Josh has always sold his lobsters on the side.  Once we got together and started working together, especially with the pandemic, we made it more established – gave it more of a structure.  We have a business name now and logo and all that stuff so, and that’s my department.  I've worked with a handful of restaurants on the island, moving different types of product – lobsters, scallops, halibut, oysters – and I've started selling at the farmers market, which I was always surprised that there was nobody selling there in Bar Harbor, but I guess, I'm glad they didn't, because now I get to do it.  I started that, I want to say, three years ago now.  I think I've had two full seasons under my belt and one half-season.  We're going into our fourth season, I guess.  


That's a whole different way of selling seafood, from having to think about the setup and how am I going to bring this product over to – it's been really interesting to realize that people actually don't care about lobster that much, which is obvious.  It's not rocket science, but nobody wants to eat lobster once a week.  I mean, I'm sure there are people that do, but the majority of people want to eat seafood but don't want to eat lobster once a week.  That's kind of why I started going for mussels and oysters, because I wanted to be able to bring more diversity to what I had.  There's obviously a demand, and I almost want to say a need that people feel to be able to access more fresh seafood.  So, yeah, I have experience with all that, too.  But if you have more specific questions, I'm happy to answer them, because I feel like I'm just talking generally about my life.  I don't know if this is useful.


F1:        [27:10] You sell crab as well.


A:        [27:12] Oh, yes.  Crabs, thank you. (laughter) I forgot about those.  Yeah.  We catch Jonah crabs in our lobster traps.


F1:        [27:18] They're just bycatch, right?  And you're marketing them?


A:        [27:21] Yeah, it's just bycatch.  I mean, we're allowed to keep it under our lobster license, but it's generally considered bycatch.  Most fishermen throw it back.  And if you ever had Jonah crab, you'll know how tasty it is.  It, again, seemed insane to me that there was no good market for it.  This is something that I'm still trying to get my head around.  I can move a few hundred crabs a year at the market.  I have to sell them whole because selling the crab claws, which is what people usually want, is a whole different license.  I think that limits me a little bit because a lot of people don't love handling live animals.  I can understand why.  But anyway, I started selling crabs at the market, and I didn't think it was going to go anywhere.  It was a total experiment.  I'd say they're more popular than lobsters now, and I'm really happy to be able to do that because any money I make off crabs is totally a win.  Anything I make is better than the zero dollars we would make, so I don't sell them at a very high price, which makes them very affordable, and everybody's happy.


F1:        [28:30] And then, one more follow-up.  In terms of your marketing that sounds like you manage, how do you identify who you're going to market to?  Is it existing contacts?  Do you use Facebook?  Do you use word of mouth?


A:        [28:41] It's a mix of both.  I'm sure that marketing is the thing that I'm weakest at because I don't love spending time on laptops and social media and all that.  But I use Facebook and Instagram.  Mostly Facebook.  There's a few local community groups that I post on.  At least once a month, I try and advertise for sales, and that's how I get new customers.  But we have a lot of repeating customers that just get in touch whenever they know that we're fishing every day.  I'm going to change the structure of how I sell a little bit this year, but the idea is that people can always come to us and be like, “Hey, do you have lobsters?”  In the summer at least, we usually have them available.  


So, it's a mix of both reaching out to new customers.  I usually try and target locals, mostly, and then once a year, at the beginning of the tourist season, I drive around the campgrounds and bed and breakfasts or motels that have kitchen space on the Bar Harbor side of the island, and we have flyers and business cards that I leave around.  That gets me more into the tourist section.  Then, by now, a lot of our customers have – a lot of our customers might have Airbnb’s, so they ask me for business cards or flyers to put in their Airbnb’s.  We've had a lot of new customers that way.  I think that's it.  That's pretty much – yeah, I rely a lot on word of mouth because there's not many of us that sell seafood directly.  It actually works pretty well.  Once a few people know, “Oh, we can buy lobsters from this person,” they spread the word pretty efficiently.  


Q:        [30:27] Do you have any experience in advocacy or community-based organizations related to fisheries?  


A:        [30:33] Not yet. (laughter) 


Q:        [30:36] Do you hope to?


A:        [30:37] Yes.  Yeah, for sure.  I used to do that stuff in the past in my previous life in Italy at the student level.  So, it's something I have experience in, just not related to fisheries here.  But I definitely see a need for it.  I always feel a little uncomfortable talking about this because I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but it really doesn't feel like the state or the federal government are very supportive of small-scale fishermen.  Between the really heavy regulations that are imposed on us with virtually no ability for us to talk about them, discuss them, or have weight in what gets decided and the lack of infrastructure – what I was going to say about the crabs is that there's no place to pick crab meat in Maine.  You'll go to any restaurant, and you'll get crab rolls and crab cakes.  But I'm not even sure that's crab that comes from Maine waters.  We don't have a stable wholesale crab market because no wholesalers want to buy crabs because they have nowhere to send it to.  To me, that's crazy.  


The state of Maine prides itself in being the lobster capital of the world, and they make a lot of money basically off the fisherman's back by drawing tourists in, but they don't support us in any real way.  I've never seen the state come to us and ask, “Hey, what would help you?” – outside of just being able to go fishing because I would love to say, “It would really help to open a processing plant here,” both for lobsters and crabs because that would create such a stronger local economy.  It would create so many more jobs connected to fisheries.  It would really reintegrate fishing into the rest of the community here.  There doesn't seem to be any interest on the state side.  


The last few years have obviously been dominated by the right whale issue, and I understand why that takes up a lot of time and energy for everybody involved.  But regardless of what happens to whales, fishermen are still going to be fishing in Maine, and you can’t just stop everything else and not think about anything else just because you have this really big, pressing issue.  There's the whole – I'm really frustrated at the lack of entry.  I want to go fishing.  I want to be able to go fishing on my own.  I have every right to.  I have the skills.  I have the interest.  I know I would be a good steward to the environment.  There's no reason why a person like me shouldn't be allowed to go fishing, but there basically is no way.  


I'm doing my apprenticeship for lobstering.  It might take me ten years to get my license, which is great.  I can keep it there in case when I'm 40, I want to go lobster fishing.  But other than that, you know, the scallop license is a lottery system I enter every year.  I enter for dive and drag, and I never get anything.  There's no way for – well, it's the same with the elver fishery.  It's a lottery-based system.  I was going to say that it's hard as a woman sometimes – that's another reason why I'm very excited about green crabs because it's a novel fishery.  Nobody's really doing it, so it creates a level playing field for everybody.  But it is harder for a woman to start going fishing for things like lobsters or scallops because of the cultural environment.  


I've never had to deal with really limiting sexism.  There definitely is sexism.  It's more like the cultural obstacles that you're going to face as a woman to try and find a boat and get a boat and get it rigged and get the collaboration and help that most young fishermen get.  I don't know if you would get that same treatment as a woman, and I don't see the state, again, doing much to help it.  I know it's a delicate issue.  They can't just be like, “Oh, we're going to reserve a few licenses for women,” when already it's such a difficult system to get into the fishery.  They can't just set licenses aside for women, but I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe we could have at least some conversations about what we could do now that there's a growing number of women and nonbinary folks that want to start fishing.  


Q:        [34:53] I definitely want to come back to that, but just before we get into that – and I know this is a hard question to answer, but what does an average day of work look like for you?  


A:        [35:02] In what fishery? (laughter)


Q:        [35:05] Take me through them.


A:        [35:06] OK, cool.  I’ll start with the easy ones.  So oystering or musseling, the way I do it, it’s very chill.  It's just supplementary for me.  I get to pick my days.  I get to pick my tides, and then it's just very relaxing.  I go out.  It's my alone time, and for two and a half hours, all I do is walk around the flats and look around.  If I find an oyster, I check that it's the right size.  It goes in the basket.  And if not, it stays there.  So, that's pretty straightforward.  


What else?  For scalloping – well, scalloping is different if you're state fishing or northern Gulf of Maine fishing, which is what we did last year.  We've done both.  We've done two seasons in the state fishery because we found someone with the license that would come on the boat with us, because neither one of us has a state license.  I think that's honestly the toughest fishery I've worked in, mostly because of the environmental conditions.  It is winter in Maine, and you're out on the water four days a week, and you're so limited.  They tell you which days you can go, and the season runs from December 1 through March 31, so that's four months.  You pretty much have to get every day in that you can.  So, unless it's blowing a 100, you're going to go fishing, which means that I've been out there in 10-degree weather with scallops freezing on deck because it's so cold.  You just have to get through it, and it really sucks. (laughter) 


But a typical day would start a little later than lobstering because you have to wait – I think they changed it now, but you usually have to wait until sunrise, and they go by Augusta times.  It might already be sunlight here, but you still have to wait.  So, say by 6:00/6:30, usually, you're starting to fish.  You might have to travel to your fishing grounds.  You might leave a little earlier than 6:00, but it's not like lobstering, where in the winter you might be going out at like 3:30, so it's a step up.  You get to your fishing grounds.  Usually, you already have your tow.  You already know where you're going to be towing unless you're prospecting, but let's assume that you already know what you're doing.  You just set your drag out in the water, tow for about 10-15 minutes, half hour, depending on a lot of factors.  


Then, once the scallops come back aboard here in the state fishery, you catch so little that you can process what you've caught and shell them before the drag comes back from the next tow.  So, that's what you usually do.  You just dump the drag.  If you have two people on board, you'll set the drag back in the water.  One person does that.  The other person starts picking through the pile.  If you're on your own, you set the drag back, and then you go to the pile.  There's a minimum size.  You usually keep every last scallop that is of legal size, and then you start shelling them.  We can only land the meat.  So, you set up at your shelling station, and the cycle goes on and on until you try and get your limit, which is three – well, it's 15 gallons of meat a day.  So, it's three buckets.  There's a conversion between how many bushels of scallops in the shell you catch that gives you those three buckets.  I don't remember what it is.  For the northern Gulf of Maine, it's like 25 bushel.  It’s probably like 18 to 20 bushel here in the state fishery.  You just keep track of it, and you try and get your limit.  Usually, you can, especially if you have a bigger drag.  


The first year that we were fishing for scallops here, we started very late in the season because we had a lot of trouble getting the boat rigged, and by then, it was kind of drying up.  We never got our limit.  But you just go until the end of the day.  I think you have to stop at either sunset or like half hour before or after, and then you come back in.  Most of the time, we were selling scallops direct.  There's a great direct sales market here in Maine for scallops, and people usually buy them in bulk, so by the gallon, which is awesome, but it also means that you come home after a day of fishing and you now have to bag those scallops and weigh them and label them and either have people pick them up that night or find a way to get them to them the next day, which you might be fishing.  So, a lot of logistics involved.  


If you're fishing down in Gloucester, it's a lot easier.  Well, for one, we're living on the boat.  So there wasn't much – just wake up and go fishing.  I want to go diving on Stellwagen Bank and see what it looks like because no matter what point in the season, no matter what we were doing, the drag would come back bulging with scallops.  There’s scallops everywhere, and they're beautiful.  You have so many that, at that point, you actually get to choose because you can get different prices depending on the size of the scallop.  So, you're getting enough scallops that you have the luxury of saying, “OK, these are small.  They're lower price.  I'm not going to deal with these.  I'm going to focus on the big ones.”  


Then the actual process is the same, except that you're getting so many scallops, the piles are so big that you don't really have the time to pick through it and shell.  What we did was just pick through the pile, get the drag back aboard, pick through the pile, get the drag back aboard until we had our 25 bushels, and then we would start shelling.  We'd start steaming back and shell.  When we're down in Gloucester, we sold to the dealer because we weren't home.  At the end of the season, we kept the catch from the last day and brought it back home to sell here.  The idea this year – I'm not going to be there full time, so I'm probably going to go back and forth a little more, bring back a few more scallops than we did last year.  But it's so simple there.  You just pull up to the dealer and unload everything, and then you're done.  


Am I talking too much?  Because there's a lot of fisheries to go through. (laughter) OK, halibut.  I love halibut fishing.  We go pretty hard with halibut, I think partly because it was Josh's first fishery as a captain.  It was the first time that he could really do something on his own, and so he went 100% in, and that's all I've ever known.  That's how I know how to go halibut fishing.  You want to work with the tides.  Be really careful about when you set your hooks, which might mean that you're fishing in the middle of the night, but it's also kind of neat because you don't have to go that far.  If you have a fast enough boat, and you're fast enough at setting you can set your gear, come back in, have a couple hours of downtime, and then go back out.  The actual fishing might take a couple hours, might take you a couple hours to set, a couple hours to haul.  It’s not like lobstering, where you're out of all day.  But it's equally as exhausting, if not more. (laughter) 


The way we do it is we get the bait, obviously.  It works out pretty well, unsurprisingly, because nature has a reason for everything, but halibut season is usually around alewife season, so we get to buy fresh alewives, which is a great bait for halibut.  Then, usually, I'll bait the tubs on the way out, and then we set them together.  I drive the boat, Josh sets the hooks, and then you just leave them there for a couple hours.  Then, you go back, and you haul them back.  If there's a fish, you bring it aboard.  Make sure it's legal.  If it's not legal, it goes back in the water.  If it's legal, it stays on the boat.  


Then, we also bring the halibut home and cut it up in steaks and filets and sell those, as opposed to the whole fish.  That goes like hotcakes because there’s not many ways to get fresh fish around here.  Then, for lobstering, which is the most, I guess, complicated one, just because there's so many different sides of it.  If we're fishing in the summer, it's pretty straightforward.  We'll leave the harbor.  We get the bait ready either the night before or the morning of.  We usually leave the harbor around 5:30/6:00.  Josh doesn't have his full 800 traps yet.  Last year, he had 500.  Yes, yes.  So, we were hauling 250 traps a day, which is really not that many.  We'd be done around 2:00.  My job on the boat, as a sternman, is to get bait bags ready, tend to the traps, empty them, measure and check all the lobsters, band the legal ones, put them in the tank, and make sure that things on deck are running smoothly so that Josh can just focus on basically driving the boat and finding good spots to set the traps.  


Once we come in, if we have any orders, that's actually the part that takes us the longest overall, is crating up, so going through the catch and grading it.  We have such a complicated system because we sell to so many different outlets, and each outlet has its own requirements.  Even the dealer this year required us to grade our lobsters.  We had to separate them based on basically the quality.  So, you might have to differentiate three different types of lobsters for the dealer.  And then, if I need lobsters for the market, I sell a certain size.  So, you have to set those aside.  Restaurants ask for a certain size.  So, you have to set those aside in separate crates for each restaurant.  It takes us an hour, sometimes, to crate up.  But that’s the name of the game, I guess.  


Once we're done that, we unload to the dealer right at the pier.  Any orders or restaurant orders we deliver or bring home for people to pick up if they're private sales.  In the winter, it's pretty much the same, except that we leave a lot earlier, we come back a lot later, and we haul the whole gang.  We haul 500 traps when we go out, which means that we usually take a third person so that I don't kill myself on deck, and we can go a little faster.  The third person usually manages the bait, so I'll tell them what to do, and they just get the bait ready, and then I'll do everything else.  So, same thing as before – get the lobsters out, go through those, send the traps back.  But it does make it easier to have a third person to help.


Q:        [45:37] Great.  Then, returning to something we were talking about a little earlier.  How do you feel that your background or identity as a woman shapes your work in the sector, including the way people perceive and treat you?


A:        [45:50] I'll start from the last part of the question because it is the easiest.  I was very worried at first because I'm a very small woman and I'm not from here, and I felt like it was the perfect cocktail to not be taken seriously by fishermen.  But apparently, I was wrong in the sense that, yeah, they probably laughed at me and giggled, not in my face, but I'm sure that they had things to say about me, but I've always been a very serious and hard worker.  At the end of the day, that's what fishermen like to see that you put in your work.  So, Bar Harbor fishermen – I've always felt accepted.  Once I started fishing with Josh, who is well known to be a very hard worker and a very serious fisherman, it solidified my position, I guess, and my reputation because they knew that he wouldn't cut me any slack.  So, if I was going fishing with him, it meant that I was doing my part.  


There's still the occasional few things here and there, like, “Oh, I'll help you with that bait,” or “I'll help you move this,” even if I probably don't need the help.  They wouldn't help a man in my position, but I kind of brush that off, and honestly, at this point, I even take advantage of it.  If they're dumb enough that they want to help me, it makes life easier for me.  I mean, after a few years, I finally feel like I'm a part of the fleet.  People will talk to me, even if it's just me and Josh isn't around.  It's harder, obviously, once you get out of your harbor.  I've been very lucky.  I've been jumping on random boats here and there on the island, even on highliner boats.  I know that being Josh's wife is a great reference.  But it also takes a certain kind of captain to take a woman because there are still a lot of captains out there that don't think we can do the work or don't think we are strong enough to stand for 16 hours or whatever it is that we're not strong enough for.  


I know that people probably think I don't understand as much about the ins and out – I don't want to say the theory behind fishing.  They probably don't think I'm as qualified a mechanic as I am, which I'm not really that qualified, but I know it enough that I could help.  But I don't think people assume that about me, and they do assume that about guys in the harbor that I know for a fact have zero mechanical experience. (laughter) I have a lot of people – I usually get more sexism from other crew members than captains.  We have a lot of issues with men coming to work on our boat and not really respecting me as the sternman, so technically, their boss.  So, they’d either not do what I say or question it, or instead of talking to me, they'll talk to Josh.  It's frustrating.  I've worked really hard to be where I'm at today.  I know that it looks like I cheated the system because it's my husband who's running the boat, but I did not cheat the system at all.  Josh is a wonderful husband and a wonderful captain, but like I said, and I'll say this until the day I die, he treated me like his crew, and I will forever be grateful to him for it.  But people don't seem to understand that.  


There's been a lot of friction with people that we've taken for a day.  Down in Gloucester, we took a guy to help us, and he wanted to change the setup of the boat, things that they would never have done had the sternman been a man.  You don't change somebody’s setup on the boat the first day that you get on that boat without even knowing what you're doing and without asking.  But because I'm a short young woman, it's apparently okay to do so.  So, that's very frustrating.  That's part of the reason why I want to go out on my own is to kind of prove people that you – there's nothing about being a man that makes you more skilled or more capable of going fishing on your own or as somebody’s deckhand.  Can you ask me the question again, because it was the first part there that I feel like –


Q:        [50:19] Sure.  How do you feel like your identity shapes your work?  


A:        [50:22] Yeah, OK.  Thank you.  I'm going to try and be articulate about this, but I don't know if I can. (laughter) I'm aware that my boots are making a lot of noise.  I feel a big difference between me and how other women in sea fishing is what are we trying to get out of it?  A lot of men around here are like, “I basically got to catch every last lobster.  I got to go as hard as I can.  I got to go offshore.  I got to fish trawls.  I got to fish big traps.”  My question is always, “For what?”  You know what I mean?  You're going to go out there.  You're going to be really hard on your body, on your boat, on your equipment.  Yes, you're going to feel great at the end of the day and like a hero.  But did you really achieve anything bigger or more useful to society than if you had been in the bay hauling pairs and singles and just maybe bringing in like a third of what you would from offshore?  


Maybe at that point, you have the time to do what I do, which is to sell directly to consumers, to keep it local, to not just unload it to the dealer and go home.  I see this a lot in other women, like, if you look up and down the coast, there's a bunch of women captains that actually are very innovative about how they run their business.  They might have a restaurant, they might have an oyster farm on top of their lobstering business, and I don't usually see men doing this.  Men just go fishing.  I feel like, as a woman – I don't know if it's because I'm a woman or because I'm a newcomer in the industry, but I feel like I bring a little more creativity and a little more innovation than people that have been in it for decades, or that have seen it done the same way for decades and think that it's some sort of fight that you have to win against I don't know who.  The ocean?  The lobsters?  I'm not sure.  


Even from a financial point of view, I don't know if what they do is the smartest thing.  I'm not here to – I know it sounds like I'm judging or criticizing, but it's not my goal here.  I'm just saying that the answer you often hear is, “Oh, this is what we have to do to make it pay.”  But I don't subscribe to that because the further out you go, the harder you go, the more expenses you have.  So, at the end of the day, I don't know if you're actually bringing in that much more.  I think it's just a different attitude. Fishermen don't see the ocean as something to empty, for sure, but I feel like a lot of women in the business have a little bit more of a nurturing attitude toward what they're doing.  At the end of the day, I think creativity is the keyword here.


Q:        [53:12] How does your role in the fishing sector work with your family or caregiving responsibilities, including looking towards the future?  


A:        [53:19] Yeah, that's a tricky one.  Like I said, we don't have children yet, but we have plans on having children.  We have a lot of pets, though, because we have three cats, a dog, and nine chickens.  We're building a homestead right now, and the plan is to have more and more animals, and that is totally because I want them.  I'm very aware that all that doesn't really marry itself with being out at sea all the time.  Even now, it's a little stressful sometimes not being able to be home and take care – when we're gone in the winter, especially, it might only be once a week, but we're gone for 14 hours.  I never realized it until recently how – it's not alienating, but it really feels like you're so disconnected from home, and then you need a day to recover, and a lot of the responsibilities that traditionally fall on women, I feel like sometimes I can't keep track of all of them.  


Josh is a wonderful partner.  He's very forward-looking in that sense.  I mean, we're kind of a 50/50 household, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.  It's more like 60/40, let's be honest.  Sometimes, it's self-inflicted in the sense that I love cooking, and I want to be doing the cooking, so I take that on for myself.  It's not like Josh expects me to cook, I guess is what I'm trying to say.  Everything that I do is because I chose to do it.  I would have the option not to do it.  But it makes it hard.  You're tired at the end of the day.  You might not feel like cooking or making a nice meal for you and your family.  This is something that has become really important for me because, as an Italian, I grew up eating healthy food, and I refuse to start eating American food just out of convenience.  


No offense, but I don't want to – we are lucky enough to live in Maine.  We have access to a lot of fresh food, and I totally want to take advantage of this.  But sometimes, that doesn't marry well with all the time that goes into fishing because it's not just the time on the water.  It's also rigging the gear, going to get the bait, and that's why, in the last few years, we've transitioned to a system where Josh takes a little bit more of that on so that I can take a little bit more of the housework on.  


In terms of looking at the future, it's very difficult for me.  I really feel like I’m – stepping off Josh's boat is a huge thing for me, and I'm excited about the green crabs, but it's not easy because I feel like I'm giving away a part of my identity and a part of my independence and autonomy.  I could do whatever – I could choose to be out on the water 16 hours a day because I had no other strings attached.  I think that's a luxury that a lot of men have and women don't.  It’s hard to even put in words what it is because even with me and Josh – he has kids.  He's the one with kids, not me.  He's the one that technically has more strings attached.  But even when he was raising them as a single parent, he always went to work, and he would have a network of family and friends that would help him take care of them, but there was never the expectation that he should stay home with the kids.  


I think part of this is societal expectations on me that I've internalized.  But if I see myself in, say, five years with one or two children, I don't know if I would feel that comfortable being like, “OK, I still want to go green crab fishing,” or “I still want to go oystering,” or “I want to take a day and go scalloping with my friends.”  


We're trying to set up our life so that we could have everything.  Josh could go fishing, and I could go fishing, and we could have kids, and we're going to take the kids on the boat once they're old enough, which is when they can walk, I guess, or probably even before that.  Just put them on the boat and get them used to it so that we can keep doing all these things that we both love without me having to sacrifice them.  I have hopes for the future, but I don't know.  


I've never had kids, so I don't know how likely it is that I can do all these things.  With the fact that we want to have a very intense home life, we don't just want to get home and relax on the couch.  We have animals.  We want to have a big garden.  We want to work the land.  I'm very aware that I may not be able to keep doing this the way that I've been doing it forever, and it sucks. (laughter)


Q:        [58:15] Thank you.  We're going to sort of shift into environmental changes now.  Can you describe any changes in the marine environment that you've noticed in your time on the water here?


A:        [58:24] Yeah.  I'm always wary of this question because I've only been doing this for five years, so I'm only just starting to notice patterns in the lobsters, for example.  But I can definitely tell you that winters are not as cold as they used to be, and that has changed the way lobsters behave.  This year was a very odd year for us, where usually you have what we call the September slump.  


In late August, early September, you see a drop in your catch.  This year, it went on for much longer than we thought.  But at the same time, we're getting shedders now.  We're out fishing 20 miles offshore, and we're catching lobsters that are soft.  They shed the day before.  I hate to not be able to give you a good answer, but I can definitely tell you that I've seen the changes.  I just don't have enough experience for my brain to really process them and be like, “Here's what the changes are.”  


I've seen a little bit of a drop in lobster numbers, but before you write anything down, I think part of it is due to the way that Josh and I have been fishing.  We tend to fish in a very short set.  By the nature of that, you don't catch as many lobsters.  I mean, cumulatively, you do.  But if you have a trap in the water for five nights, or you have a trap in the water for two nights, when you bring those traps aboard, they're going to look very different.  I think that's where my impression of a declining number of lobsters is coming from.  There are statewide trends that the numbers are going down slightly, but I haven't seen anything worrying.  We're still seeing a lot.  


That's one change that I've seen, and that you can definitely – I’ll stand by it.  There's a lot more shorts than there used to be.  There's a lot shorter lobsters with eggs than there used to be, and there's a lot more eggers than there used to be.  When I say, “used to be,” I mean five years ago.  Again, not that much of a timeline, but it's crazy.  There are lobsters that are several times – they’re not close to legal size.  They're maybe two, three molts away from being legal size, and they have eggs like teen moms.  It's crazy.  


F2:        [1:00:43] That's so funny.  I fish in Gouldsboro, and that's literally what we would call them.  “Oh, we have another teen mom.”


A:        [1:00:49] Yeah, teen mom.


F2:          [1:00:50] And they were so small.


A:        [1:00:51] Yeah, crazy.  So, you find them in the bay, too?


F2:        [1:00:53] Yeah.


A:        [1:00:54] Because I've seen them mostly offshore.  It’s interesting to know that they're everywhere.  Yeah, they're tiny.  I know that it's connected to the water temperature because it triggers their sexual maturity earlier.  So, yeah, definitely a lot more of those, and a lot more eggers in general, even big ones, oversized ones.  I always hear Josh complain about the tides.  I always hear everybody complain about the tides.  This is not something I've directly observed in the sense that I don't – I mean, I pay attention to it, but I don't experience it as directly as they do because basically what happens is that the tide, instead of turning when it's supposed to turn, it's either early or late by one to two hours, which kind of messes your day up in terms of planning.  


But this is not onshore.  When I go oystering, the tide is usually spot on, but when you're out on the water, that's where they notice the changes.  I know that it's not just Josh because I hear everybody on the radio asking, “Hey, what's the tide doing over there?” and complaining about that.  What else?  Let me think.


Q:        [1:02:04] You had mentioned green crabs.


A:        [1:02:06] Yes.  Well, we don't catch many green crabs in the lobster traps, but I do see a lot of them when I go out oystering.  We used to fish actually right here on the shore of COA, so very shallow water, and the traps used to be full of green crabs.  I know that Chris does his survey there and that it shows so.  When I go oystering, they're everywhere from, like, tiny, tiny, thimble sized crabs to five, six inches across, nice big ones.  I hate to say it, but I'm not totally sure how they're reacting to the temperature.  I don't know what their ideal temperature range is, so I don't know if they're already being affected by climate change or not.  


But the other thing that I wanted to mention was that we're seeing a lot of codfish in the traps and dogfish.  We never used to catch dogfish, and this winter, we've seen, I don't know, five to 10 dogfish, which is pretty cool.  All alive.  All released.  Same with the cods.  Big cods.  I mean, they're not big for what they used to be, but they're nice, sizable ones.  We catch cusk, too, which we're seeing more of.  There's one other thing that I thought.  This doesn't often come up.  Oh yeah, we've been catching these deep-water eels.  I don't know what they're called, but I can try and look it up if you guys want to know more in detail.  


F1:        [1:03:30] Hagfish?


A:        [1:03:31] They're not hagfish.  They're just big black eels.  They're pretty thick across, ugly looking. (laughter) Josh doesn't know what they are, not that he's an expert, but he's been fishing long enough that usually he knows what this stuff is, but yeah, he's not sure what those are.  


Q:        [1:03:59] And how are those changes impacting your work?


A:        [1:04:02] Right now, for me as a deckhand, they're not really impacting it, to be honest with you, but being married to a captain and seeing the ins and outs of it – the tide thing drives everybody insane.  It’s not a long-term problem.  It's more of an inconvenience.  But I can assure you that it creates a lot of stress among fishermen.  If you want to then talk about mental health and all that aspect of fishing, I think this is an interesting thing to think about.  Most fishermen think that the tide changes are related to climate change, and so even something like that that doesn't affect your bottom line, but it affects the smoothness of the day.  It increases your stress levels.  


I'm joking about it, but it's not actually negligible to be angry the whole day because the tide is not doing what it's supposed to.  But other than that, I'm more thinking about the future.  In that sense, it's impacting me – in the sense that I know I want to make a living on the water, so I'm trying to think now, what can I do to be ready for whatever is going to come in the next decade or so?  That's part of the reason why, yes, I'm doing my lobster apprenticeship, but I'm not planning my whole life around going lobster fishing.  


I'm looking at green crabs, which I think is a great emerging opportunity.  I'm starting to think about aquaculture, which, like I said, I don't love the work, but I see the value of it.  I'm a little worried about what the lobster population is going to do in terms of how they're going to react physiologically.  Are they still going to shed around the same time of year?  Because it doesn't look like it.  Are we still going to see those huge volumes of lobsters that people were seeing up until a few years ago in the summer?  Because we haven't really, and with warming temperatures too, the quality of the lobsters, I think, has decreased.  Their shells stay softer a little longer.  They're weaker.  


For us, where we sell to restaurants, sometimes we need to float lobsters because they might not need them that day, and it creates a problem for us because if surface temperature is too high, the lobsters might die.  We've been trying to come up with solutions to that problem.  There are none. (laughter) We should probably set up a tank at home, but that's a lot of money.  If we wanted to set up a tank at home, we would need to have a cooling system, and we would have to keep the water clean.  It’s not that simple.  Luckily, it hasn't been a huge issue.  For now, it only happens a few days of the year that we need to float them so we can work around that.  


If I was running a business where I was entirely selling direct, that would be definitely something to keep in mind.  I'll find out this year with green crabs – because you have to keep them in the water to let them molt.  I'll see how they do being kept in a crate, in surface water, exposed to the sun, in warm waters, not being able to do what they would normally do, which is maybe they would hide under the rockweed after they’ve shed to stay cool.  They can’t do that in a crate.  So, I’ll see how climate change impacts me then.


Q:        [1:07:34] Yeah.  Is there anything that you've tried in response to this?  I know you mentioned that maybe there's some stuff you can't do, but is there anything you have tried?  


A:        [1:07:42] I can't think of anything right now but let me think on this.  I’ll put it in the back of my brain. (laughter)


Q:        [1:07:52] Yeah, we can come back to that.  Is there anything you would like to try?


A:        [1:07:58] Differently –


Q:        [1:08:00] In response to these environmental changes, yeah. 


A:        [1:08:02] Yeah.  I'd like to see more information being shared about potential new fisheries.  I'd like to see a little bit more preparedness that isn't just, “What are we going to do about lobsters?”  I feel like that's the big conversation right now.  “Ooh.  What are we going to do about lobsters with climate change?”  It's like, well, the ocean is pretty big, and there's a lot of stuff in there that can be caught and eaten.  So, maybe instead of thinking, “What are we going to do about lobsters,” we could think, “What else could we do to keep the fishing community alive, and what would they need to succeed?”  I don't know what the answer is.  So, unfortunately, I can't give you a very good answer (laughter), but I think that's the thing that I'd like to see differently.  Why is the state not encouraging more people to get into green crabs, for example?  It's beyond me why there is no push at the local or the state level to do something about a problem that – it's not solvable, but it can be managed, at least at the local scale, and it would relate to – it is directly related to environmental changes.  


Similarly, why, for example, are we not trying to expand the scallop fishery?  There’s contrasting views on how the resource is doing.  It depends on who you ask.  At the same time, it's kind of an underutilized resource.  There's not that many scallop boats.  There's a good market for them, and it happens in the winter, which might make it easier.  It might make it a little more sheltered to environmental change in a way.  But there's not much being done there, either.  Pogies are coming back.  Herring, they're coming back.  Clearly, cod is coming back.  I'm not saying let's open ground fishing up again.  But as far as I'm aware, it would be very hard for me to go out and catch codfish commercially, even if I wanted to hand line for it.  And why is that?  The resource is there.  You don't always have to go big.  It doesn't always have to be a 50-foot boat fishery that needs three people on deck and several $1,000 of equipment involved.  


You can respond to climate change and to environmental change by thinking, “OK, what do we have now?” and, “Are there ways to utilize these resources in a way that is sustainable?”  I think there are.  The lobstering industry is a small-scale fishery, but if you look at small-scale fisheries around the globe, this is not a small-scale fishery.  If you go to most other countries and look at the size of the boats, the state of the boats, the amount of money that is involved in fishing is not like lobstering at all, and yet, fishermen exist everywhere in the world, and they make a living, and they survive.  You might not have a million-dollar boat, but if you're just trying to make a living on the water, maybe you don't need the million-dollar boat.  I think the state and fishermen alike are kind of missing out on all these smaller opportunities that I think should be pursued to make the community, the fishing community, more resilient to environmental change.


Q:        [1:11:29] Yeah, absolutely.  What do you think your biggest concern is for the future, which I think is sort of on that note?  If you could tell policymakers one thing that you really want them to think about and consider as we move forward, what would you say?  


A:        [1:11:43] Let us go fishing for more than just lobsters.  Let us actually go fishing and experiment.  Give us the shoreside infrastructure to make these markets happen.  Right now, if we wanted to go groundfishing out of our harbor, we could never do that.  We need ice.  We need trucks to get the fish delivered.  We could do that, but it would take a lot of work, and usually, that work falls on the fishermen.  That’s not fair because being a fisherman is already like two or three full-time jobs put in one and to add more on top of that is not feasible.  Put some money and some thought and collaborate with fishermen and people on the ground to figure out how we can diversify the fishing industry in Maine.  Don't just rely on lobster.  I know that it's a great money-maker.  I know people love lobsters, but there's more to the Gulf of Maine than that.  I'd like to see actual working waterfronts, and not like the Bar Harbor pier, where we have two heists, one of which never works, and the other one doesn't either, and the ramp’ broken.  


I know there's been a lot of big storms that have created damage.  That's not what I'm concerned about.  But we don't have good waterfront facilities in Bar Harbor.  There's some waterfront facilities around the island, but a lot of those are privately owned.  You have to work there to be able to use them.  It's not always that straightforward.  Really, the main concern for me is the marketing and processing side of things, like the fact that there are no real resources right now in Maine for fishermen to keep their product here and to pursue value-added products in Maine without having to export them.  The dealers go do a great job moving our product.  I will never understand how they move all those lobsters that they move in the summer, but they do it, and it's great, and I'm thankful for them.  I think there are more sustainable ways to deal with the thousands and thousands of pounds of seafood that we bring in every year.


Q:        [1:13:57] I'm curious if you think that there are resources fishermen have in order to address some of these changes.


A:        [1:14:04] Do you mean institutionally or any?


Q:        [1:14:07] Any kind. I have a list here – relationships, knowledge, training, organization.  I totally hear that the state needs to do so much infrastructure-wise.  Do you think that fishermen have capacity in a certain way to address it in other ways?


A:        [1:14:23] I think yes.  In theory, yes.  In reality, it's hard.  I've been thinking for a few years now about starting a fisherman's co-op here on the island.  For example, my main barrier is property.  I would not have a place to do this, or not easily.  I can't buy waterfront property in Bar Harbor.  It's totally out of the question, or probably anywhere on the island.  I haven't actively been pursuing this, so I'm sure that I could come up with something.  The ferry terminal is a waterfront property that is being built right now.  They're looking for ideas on how to use it.  But yes.  To answer your question, yes, fishermen can could.  They would have the potential to self-organize.  


There's a few really good associations out there, like the MLA.  There's a new one that started recently called the – I think it's the New England Fishermen Stewardship Association.  I'm not sure their acronym is NEFSA, and I know they’ve been doing a lot of advocacy work at the state and federal level.  The biggest obstacle is getting fishermen together, I think, and getting them to work together, especially fishermen that work independently that don't go through a wharf or a co-op.  The sense of identity and of “I'm doing this on my own” is so strong, and things are working well enough right now that it's hard to convince people that it would be useful to start thinking about the future in a different way.  Because there technically is no need right now.  If you're not being super long-sided, you could go fishing for another 10 years or so, probably, and make a good living and then worry about it then.  


I feel like it's a little hard to get fishermen organized.  I feel a huge barrier in this, being a woman and not being from here, to go back to your original question.  I think fishermen around here take me seriously as a deckhand, but I think if I started to try and organize something, they'd laugh my way out of the town.  I might be wrong.  I hope I'm wrong.  But I don't feel like I have enough social capital to really get people together right now and be taken seriously.  That's another barrier for women to answer your previous question.  


What else could we do?  I think the Bar Harbor case is pretty – it's a case in point because there's been a lot of discussions about what to do with the ferry terminal, and one of the options was to move commercial fishermen up there, and most fishermen around here – I helped the town do a survey and all that, so I have a pretty good idea of what fishermen thought of that idea, and they were not into it.  I understand why.  There's a lot of cultural and emotional attachment to the town pier, and there's something to be said about having a commercial fishing operation happening in the heart of town.  But also, I thought that was a pretty neat opportunity to have a lot of space and to design it exactly how we wanted it, to design it thinking about the future.  But I guess most other people didn't see it that way for now.


Q:        [1:17:47] Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation strategy training programs that sort of thing?


A:        [1:17:54] I actually have not.


Q:        [1:17:55] What strategies do you think would be really effective in building resilience against climate-related impacts for fisheries?  


A:        [1:18:05] See, this is such a tricky question, and it's part of the reason why I've never been to training because I've been to other training along the lines of those, and I never really felt like the information is that's given to you is that useful in real life.  They might say things like, “Oh, you have to diversify,” and “You could diversify by starting an aquaculture farm,” but those aren't – people already know this stuff.  I mean, I'm talking without knowing what they actually tell you in these specific workshops because I haven't done one.  I don't know what would be more useful.  I'm trying to think because I also hate being one of those people that just complains and never has a solution.  Ask me the question again.


Q:        [1:19:00] What strategies do you think would be effective in building resilience against climate-related impacts?  


A:        [1:19:05] OK.  For example, I'd like to see the state organize zone council meetings sort of with fishermen and say, “OK, we want to come up with – what would help you guys get ready for the future?”  Maybe these are some of our goals that we'd like to see in the fleet.  We'd like to see a more diversified fleet.  We'd like to see an X-percent increase in aquaculture farms, whatever.  I'm sure the state has some goals that they've set, or even the Island Institute or any other institution that's involved in resilience work.  These are some of the goals that we've set.  How do they align with your goals?  Are you interested in these?  How can we help you achieve your goals?  Maybe fishermen want to diversify not by going into aquaculture but by being able to process their lobsters in-state.  


I'm just thinking out loud here.  Or creating an easier way to sell to restaurants.  It’s so complicated to sell to restaurants, especially for us with a federal license.  It’s not as straightforward as going to the chef and being like, “Hey, do you want some fresh lobsters?”  Which is how it should be.  Why is it not that way?  What better way to track where your food comes from than to have the fishermen show up at your door and give you the lobsters?  But it's not that simple.  


So, maybe that would be a way to increase people's resilience because don't rely on just the wholesale market anymore.  You can become a little more creative.  You don't have to work as hard, which might mean that you can then have another job.  It used to be a thing in Maine that people didn't just do one thing.  They had a very diversified portfolio of jobs.  A lot of fishermen did that, too.  I don't think everybody wants to go as hard as they have to these days.  So, if there were options to make the fishing work more valuable and free up some time to do other things, that's another way to create resilience, I think, and diversify.  I'd go for resilience training like that. (laughter) 


I'd like to see a little more help and qualified help in figuring out licenses and permits and a little more – yeah, a little more clarity.  For example, selling oysters is very confusing.  Maybe I'm just not very smart, but I also know that – I'm not saying this to brag, but I have a master's degree.  I have training in reading complicated documents and extracting information out of them, and to this day, I sometimes read instructions on how to apply for fishing licenses, and I don't understand what I have to do.  It makes me wonder, what about a person that might have come out of high school and decided to go fishing, and now they have to figure this out?  If I can't, with all the years of academia that I have behind me – maybe I'm just dumb, and they're smart, and they figure it out.  But it just makes me wonder – why is it so complicated?  


Where there’s a lot of different entities involved – for example, to sell at farmers markets, you might need authorization from the Department of Agriculture if you're selling a value-added product.  I'm telling you right now, there is no clear way of understanding this from any website at all.  So, something like that would be helpful to either have like a point person at the DMR that actually knows what they're talking about and can help you figure it out, or have a training once a year, once every six months – I don't know – where they say, “We're here to help you.  This is what you want to do.  You want to sell lobster.  You want to turn lobster tail.”  Oh, my God.  “You want to catch lobsters, make frozen tails, and sell them to restaurants.  This is what you need to do to do that.  You want to go harvest mussels and sell your mussels door to door.  This is what you need to do to do that.”  Because the flip side of that is that if you don't do the right thing and you get a fine – I want to be in compliance.  I have no interest in breaking the law.  I can't afford to break the law most of the time because the fines are pretty hefty.  So, that’d be a cool resilience training to go to.


Q:        [1:23:10] Yeah.  Are there any other kinds of changes that are affecting your work that feel super relevant or that you want to talk more about?  


A:        [1:23:18] I don't really want to talk about it, but I will mention it.  The federal government is really coming down on us with all those regulations, and specifically for us, it's making it very hard to sell directly to consumers, which I really – can I swear?  I really think it's fucked up.  I don't understand why a government would want to put barriers into getting food to its people because that's literally what's happening right now.  We are technically only allowed to sell product caught in federal waters to federally authorized dealers, and I just don't understand why.  There is nobody that can talk me into agreeing with this or seeing any benefit to this.  I don't think it benefits the resource.  I don't think it benefits fishermen.  I don't think it benefits the consumer.  I don't think it benefits the local economy.  It creates a lot of paperwork.  It creates a lot of work that doesn't need to happen.  


I might now have to become a federally authorized dealer, like me personally, with all the costs involved in that to be able to sell lobsters to the restaurant that's a 10-minute drive from the pier.  I just don't see the point.  On top of that, they want us – we have to report every time we fish.  We have two trackers on the boat now that track our position every 30 seconds or so.  None of that makes me want to be a part of the industry.  There's a lot of other things that do, but that does not make me want to be a part of the industry.  There's a very widespread feeling that it's been designed to do that to you, to not make you want to go fishing, to make it so hard that you're just like, “Whatever.  I'm not going to deal with it,” especially if you're an owner-operated business.


Q:        [1:25:14] Yeah.  How are people coping with that feeling?


A:        [1:25:16] There's a lot of anger and frustration.  Like, a lot of anger.  I think fishermen are a very stubborn group of people, thankfully, and very resilient, and they're probably – most of them are going to push through.  But there's, like I said, a lot of anger, and a lot of people are tired and have no motivation or interest in working with the government anymore, which, again, I don't understand why you'd want to create that with your own people.  You're supposed to be there to serve them and make their life easier.  This is the exact opposite of it.  Now, you have to report every time you go fishing, like I said, and it's a 10-to-15-minute process, but you can only do it online.  


There's a lot of fishermen, not even older ones – I have friends that are about my age that don't feel comfortable doing that, and it's perfectly legitimate.  I don't expect a NOAA person to be comfortable going out fishing.  Their work is computer work.  I don't expect a fisherman to be comfortable doing computer work.  It's not their field of expertise.  That means extra money because now these fishermen often hire – there's now agencies that offer their services to do the reporting for you, so now you have to spend extra money to do that.  People are sick and tired of it, regardless of their gender or years in the industry or field that they're in.  From what I can see now, the result is that a lot of fishermen don't want to collaborate with the government anymore.  I think that's really to the detriment of everybody involved, including the resource.


Q:        [1:27:07] Can you tell me about any positive changes or opportunities that you've seen?


A:        [1:27:12] (laughter) I can try. (laughter) Well, actually, after all that I've said about sexism, I do see a lot more opportunities opening up for women.  There's a lot more captains that are willing to take women on board, and because of the student program, there's also a lot of young girls and women that have gone up – they've grown up fishing, and they're now coming into their full commercial license.  So, I'm expecting to see an increasing number of women captains out there.  To me, that's a really cool thing because that's how you get a strong and resilient fleet and a strong and resilient community, is by diversifying the kind of people that can access industries and can get a job and can be fulfilled and can have some personal successes.  Not everybody wants to have a nine-to-five job, and it's important for the overall health of the community that each individual can, I think, realize themselves and their goals.  I think that's pretty cool.  


I see a lot more interest from the general public in eating seafood and eating local seafood.  I think the pandemic helped with that.  I think having a few people that actually go out and try and get their product to the general public helps.  It's kind of a virtuous cycle.  That's encouraging because it means that there's individuals in there that see the opportunity.  They're like, “Oh, there's a demand for local seafood.  Maybe I can start a process –.”  I keep going back to the processing plants.  But just to say there’s people that are seeing shoreside opportunities in this increased interest in local seafood, and again, that's a great thing for everybody.  It's a great thing for us fishermen.  It's great for the community.  You create more jobs and all the good things that come with it.  


In terms of positive things that I'm seeing from environmental change, I tend to be a little doom and gloom when I think about climate change, but if we really want to look at the silver lining, there are emerging fisheries that could potentially become viable and support families in the future.  Not quite yet, but between green crabs and – is it the black –? – yeah, black sea bass that's kind of coming in our waters, or other species that may appear or come back – I don't know.  But if we have to find something positive in climate change, I guess that’s it.  The ocean is always going to provide.  There's always going to be something that we can catch and make a living on.  I'm a little worried about shellfish harvesters, but hey, what can you do?  


Q:        [1:30:14] Why are you worried about shellfish harvesters?


A:        [1:30:16] Well, usually, things like oysters don't grow as – no, actually, that's not true.  It's the cold that’s not good for oysters.  But it creates a lot of bacterial – what is it called?  Vibrio.  There's more risks of bacteria-born illnesses with warm weather, warm temperatures, and higher risks of emergency closures when shellfish harvesters can't go to work.  That’s why I'm a little worried.  


Q:        [1:30:45] Touching on some of the things you mentioned at the end there, what do you think is your hopeful vision for Maine's future for fisheries?


A:        [1:30:53] I'd like to see a way more diverse fleet than we have now in terms of fisheries that we have access to.  I'd like to see more small boats out there.  So, even if it means having more fishermen, I don't mind.  Instead of having one big boat, I'd rather have two small boats.  I'd like to see more creative aquaculture happening.  When I said earlier that I'm thinking about that, I'm really interested in permaculture, and I really like to try and do that on the water.  I think it can be done.  Just having multi-species, more integrated farms instead of just focusing on one product.  You can do it on land, so I don't see why you couldn't do it on water.  It might take a little more work, but you can grow.  


For example, my friends that have the mussel farm have nets outside the farm, outside the mussel ropes to keep birds out, and they're kind of effective.  But for one, sometimes birds die because they get tangled up in them.  And for two, you have to keep them clean, which involves work and time and money and equipment.  I'm not into any of that.  I've always been thinking, “Why not grow kelp around your mussels and have a high-density kelp forest with all the environmental benefits that that brings to the ecosystem and to your mussels?”  You can harvest the kelp, probably, if you grow it right, maybe not all of it, but you can harvest some of it.  You don't have to spend money on equipment.  You don't have birds dying on you, which I'm not a big fan of.  Maybe it's being done somewhere around the coast.  But this is the sort of idea that I'm playing around with.  


For example, oyster farmers have huge problems with green crabs.  I've never seen an oyster farm set a green crab trap, and that, to me, is wild.  When you have a garden, you put up fences against deer, right?  Why not do the same thing on the water?  You're on the water already.  Whoever's working for you probably has the knowledge to haul a few green crab traps.  It may not make – it would make a bit of a difference.  It wouldn't make a huge difference, but it’d make a bit of a difference.  Now you have a different product that you can market, and you can sell, and it increases your revenue and it makes your farm stronger.  Yeah.  So, I'd like to see more of that stuff happening in aquaculture.  


Q:        [1:33:24] Great.  Thank you.


A:        [1:33:25] You're welcome.  


Q:        [1:33:26] Is there anything else you wanted to share with us before we wrap-up?  


A:        [1:33:28] No, I feel like I've talked for so long.  


Q:        [1:33:32] Hillary or Jess, do you have any questions before we turn off the recorder?


A:        [1:33:37] Let me think.  


F1:        [1:33:38] Oh, there was one follow-up question.  You talked about being interested in having kids in the future.  Would you want them to go into fisheries?


A:        [1:33:46] Yeah, I'd love for them to be able to work on the water.  So, Josh's kids fish.  They've been fishing since they were eight years old, and they may not love it the way that we do, but it's so cool.  I met them when they were 12 and 14.  So, just coming into young teenagers, creating their identity and stuff, and just thinking of what opportunity that is for a young person to be out on the water on your own, and that sense of accomplishment and skill-building, and – what's the word? independence and ability to do things.  I think it's great.  I think not many kids get that anymore because a lot of us grow in – our life is usually pretty channeled from a very young age.  


I think fishing gives you a lot of freedom, and not the kind of freedom that – it’s not like, “Oh, I'm going to go partying” freedom, not that kind of freedom, more like an internal freedom that is very valuable.  It’s a cool job.  It's hard work, but it's a cool job.  It's better than being indoors, I think.  So, yes, I would absolutely love for my kids to have a chance – my unborn kids to have a chance to work on the water.


Q:        [1:35:44] Great.  I will go ahead and stop the recording.  


A:        [1:35:46] Cool.


Q:        [1:35:47] Great.


END OF FILE"
"5","A:        [0:00] You’re like oh, my gosh, do we have to take cover?


Q:        [0:03] Yeah.  I’m like let’s go.


A:        [0:10] What do we take the jeep or your truck, because the jeep pretty much is about 60 miles an hour too.


Q:        [0:15] Yeah, you got to take the truck because its got the back if we need to live out of it.


A:        [0:23] Oh, I’m, sorry.


Q:        [0:24] All right, OK, so let’s start with family background and identity.  How do you like to introduce yourself?        


A:        [0:32] OK, how do I like to introduce myself?  These are really hard questions already.  (laughter) You edit this stuff right?


Q:        [0:47] If you want.


A:        [0:50] I guess I would introduce myself as a girl from the East Coast that loves to be by the water and family oriented.  And – yeah.  (laughter)


Q:        [1:09] That’s perfect.  Tell me about where you grew up.  


A:        [1:13] So I actually grew up in Corea.  My grandparents raised me for the first five years of my life while my mom finished school and my dad finished school.  And that was the best years that I can remember and I think that’s why I continuously want to come back to this area.  Why I moved back home last year because I realized  that my heart is here.


Q:        [1:44] Where are your parents from and what do they do?


A:        [1:47] So my dad is from this area, from Corea, he’s a lobsterman and my mom is from this area, she’s in Connecticut but I don’t really have contact with her.


Q:        [2:04] OK and it sounds like you spent a lot of time with your grandparents.  What did they do?


A:        [2:09] They were lobstermen, lobster fishermen.  My grandfather went for awhile by himself and then when he got to be a little bit older then my grandmother ending up going on the boat with him.       


 Q:        [2:25] How long did they fish together for? 


A:        [2:29] Oh my goodness, I don’t know the exact time but I do know that it was multiple years that they ended up going together.  And my grandmother can’t say anything better than being out there with him and it was just time that they still could spend together and just do the job.  And help one another.


Q:        [2:53] That’s awesome.  Do you have any siblings?    


A:        [2:56] I do.  I have a lot of siblings, mixed family, brothers and sisters from all kinds of different branches.


Q:        [3:11] That’s great.  Do any of them live around here? 


A:        [3:13] They do.


Q:        [3:14] Are any of them involved in the fisheries?


A:        [3:19] We’ll just keep going.


Q:        [3:20] OK, that sounds good.  Do you have any history of fishing in your family?  This kind of tied back to the –


A:        [3:27] Repetitive.  Yes.  Yes my dad, is a lobsterman and then my grandfather and then my grandmother.  I recently have just started to be interested in the boat when I moved back home.  Last year I didn’t have a job, so I ended up getting on the boat with my dad which – it was great to be out there except for tasting breakfast twice a day.


        And then I ended getting off of the boat but I missed it because there was just – the ocean has a healing power and just being out there too and being a part of it, it’s generational thing.   So it was a little bit more than just a job.  It was OK, I wonder how many seagulls were actually my grandfather coming to visit us on the boat.  (laughter)


        So and then my son actually came back from Farmington this summer to stay here and he’s on the boat with my dad as his stern man.  I fill in when he’s not available and he’s having a great time.  


Old wives tale another fisherman told out in Winter Harbor was to eat a green apple so I tried that – with ginger chews and I didn’t get sick.


Q:        [4:51] Awesome.  I haven’t heard that one.  Do you have any history of family in working in other roles in the fishing industry such as bookkeeping, fish processing, marketing or with bait or gear?


A:        [5:05] So my grandmother actually used to work at Stinson’s.  I believe my uncle also worked at Stinson’s for a little while, but she always has so many stories of when she was back there canning.  Just talking about her friends that she used to work with and the fact that they used to walk back and forth, and her lunch pail.  And it’s kind of neat to hear about everything like that.


Q:        [5:32] Yeah, did you ever work there?


A:        [5:33] I did not.


Q:        [5:35] OK, are you married?


A:        [5:37] No.


Q:        [5:38] Do you have any children?


A:        [5:39] Yes.


Q:        [5:41] How old are they?


A:        [5:42] They are 21 and 19.


Q:        [5:45] Do you want your children to go into fishing or a related marine industry?


A:        [5:51] I don’t know if I want them to but if they did I think it would kind of excite me because I feel like it’s becoming a loss within the generations because so many people don’t want to do it.  I was actually super excited when my youngest came to me and said I think I want to go on the boat with Gramp, do you think he’ll have me?


        Because there’s that possibility that he might get interested in it to the point where he would stay in it, even if it’s just a summer thing because I know that his main goal is to become a teacher.  So he could do that throughout the school year and then during the summer go fishing, which is really the time that would dad would need him anyway and my dad’s not getting any younger.  So that would be a huge help for him.


Q:        [6:43] That’s great.  What’s your dad’s boat’s name?


A:        [6:45] Courtney Leann.  (sp?)


Q:        [6:46] Is that your sister?


A:        [6:48] Sister.


Q:        [6:49] Oh.  All right, I’m going to switch into questions about your role in this sector.  How would you describe your role in the fishing or aquaculture industry in Maine?


A:        [6:59] So right now there’s not much of a role.  I did work at the Winter Harbor Co-op for a little while as a bookkeeper, which after being on the boat last summer with my dad it actually became full circle for me, because you were able to see the data input put in after the fishermen sold the lobsters to the co-op, to the point of the gear where fishermen coming in and ordering their gear and figuring out all of the different gear, compared to the shaft zincs to the knives that they use to the rubber pans, to the oil pans that they have to order.  


So it was kind of cool to see that full circle because you knew – I already had experienced the catching the lobsters from the trap.  The measuring, the banding, the selling them to the co-op but I never knew what happened really after that, and within the office area you actually get to see that happen.  Not so much with the bait, I mean I saw it delivered and what the actual vats were and everything else, but yeah, everything kind of made sense at that point.   


Q:        [8:25] And were you in charge of kind of figuring out where you guys were getting bait from?


A:        [8:31] I wasn’t, the manager was.  So and that was just from a couple of different companies that we were dealing with.  But I know Corea Co-op – with me staying at my grams I see a lot of the different trucks coming in.  


        As a matter of fact, I just met a gentleman a couple weeks ago who traveled all the way from Florida.  And I stopped to talk to him and asked him – because I saw his license plate, I said are you actually coming from Florida and he said yes I am.  I said holey moley, that is a long ways for bait.  And he’s like, yep it’s not my first trip either, I’ve been here before.  And I was like wow.  So –


Q:        [9:12] Yeah, that part’s super interesting, where the bait’s coming from and where the lobsters are going is totally a mystery for me because when you work for the co-op you pick it up and you drop it off at the end of the day.


A:        [9:24] Exactly.  Yeah, and I always thought that – because I know over in Winter Harbor we just dealt with local companies so to actually see somebody coming that far to deliver bait was interesting, and then you just wonder too is it because there’s not enough bait in this area, and why is that?  Is it a price thing and why is that?  So kind of raises questions to of anybody that’s interested in it and curiosity of hmm, why are we doing it a certain way.


Q:        [9:58] Totally.  Do you hold any commercial fishing licenses?


A:        [10:04] I do not.  


Q:        [10:06] Do you have any experience in the industry beyond directly fishing or harvesting itself?  You mentioned bookkeeping and potentially did you work – do you work with your dad on any gear preparation.  I’ll go through the list –in bookkeeping, bait or gear preparation, in post harvest, processing, marketing, trade, in advocacy or community based organizations related to fisheries.


A:        [10:34] No, not really.  The only thing I do help out with is the LEEDS Program (sp?) with my dad at the end of the year.  Well, actually, throughout the year because he’s not technically inclined when it comes to some of the computer stuff, so I have helped him with that.  I’ve helped him a lot with some of the grants that have been coming about because of the December/January storms.  Which – that’s sad in itself just to see all the devastation and I really, really hope that they can get some help.  Just the little guys.  I know a lot of the concentration seems to be on the bigger guys, but you can't forget about the little guys either.  


Q:        [11:20] Yeah, were you guys affected by the storms in January?


A:        [11:24] Yes, the wharf that has been there since I was a little girl is gone completely. And my dad actually was there videotaping it, watching it go.  So that was rough to get that text message of, she's gone.  And that was actually the wharf that my dad had helped my grandfather build back in 1976.  


Q:        [11:52] Wow.


A:        [11:53] So, yeah, it was, it was bittersweet because, it's – there's a lot of memories there and there's a lot of work that had been done on that place generation-wise.


Q:        [12:09] Totally, I remember, when you interviewed your grandma, she talked about how she looks out the window and like, checks on the boats and if someone leaves their lights on she knows.


A:        [12:22] She is like the harbor queen.


Q:        [12:24] Yeah.  I'm sure it was hard to watch the storm this year, or in January.


A:        [12:29] Yes, because, she has, and she really is like the harbor keeper almost.
and, I mean, even when it's going to rain it's, oh, all the boats are pointing a certain way.  It's going to rain.  Oh, there's starting to turn.  Maybe it's not going to rain.
So, yeah, it was hard.


And I like the excitement of the storm.  I don't know what it is.  But, there was an excitement there because of the storm, but then also the, I don't want say grief, but you know what's going to happen.  After you see some of the boats and like some of the dinghy’s leaving, getting off of the mooring, coming off the mooring – the wharves, the stuff starting to float by as you're sitting there, you know, by the water.  That was, I can't think of the term to use, but you just knew that it was going to be devastating for some of these people.  And that was kind of sad because it's all rebuild from there.


Q:        [13:44] Can you go in a little more depth about what you mentioned about hoping that the little guys get more help?


A:        [13:51] So, I was actually going to write an article into, the news, whether it be the
news station or the newspaper because I feel like there’s been bills that have been put out there that, or even the grants, going through the last grant, helping
my dad.  Some of the questions that were on that questionnaire, was, is this a working waterfront?  How many people are on this waterfront and it's all geared towards 10 plus.  And a lot of the times, that's not what you're dealing with.
You're only dealing with a wharf that has the captain and the stern man.


And actually, I mean, a lot of the times the stern man aren't even really working on
that wharf, it's the captain that's working on that wharf.  I do think I believe, no, don't quote me, but I do believe there are some wharves that there's a couple people that are working on them.  But those are the little guys and the bigger guys are so commercialized already that, not saying that they don't deserve help in rebuilding, but I just don't think that we should – I'm trying to be politically correct.


I feel like they're already in the limelight so much and that we can't just let the little
guys just go under it because a lot of these guys are, this is their livelihood.  This is what they, this is their income.  This is their home life so if we don't help them sometimes with these bigger amounts of costs for rebuild, what are they going to do?  Like are they going to be able to continue to fish?  Are they going to be able to have the ease to be able to go down to their wharf and hold their traps there and work on their traps, come spring time ready for the summer season or winter time ready for – although most of them are in the garages during the winter time.  


But I know that last spring when I came home, that's where I found my dad was down on the wharf working on his traps and getting them ready for the next season.
So without that, then where do they go?


Q:        [16:33] What does an average day of work look like for you?  I know you're in a bit of a transition, so you can kind of go with that question wherever you'd like.


A:        [16:40] OK, so let's, let's do it two different ways here.  So my average day, if I'm on the boat with my dad filling in, then I have gone to bed at 8.30, 8:00 or 8.30 because 4 o'clock mornings suck.  And I'm up and actually staying with my grandmother at this point.  She's up as well saying, come on honey, you got to move, you got to remember your lunch, you got to remember this.  Don't forget this, you got to get out there, he's going to be waiting for you.  I think it's excitement for her to be able to relive that a little bit.


So yes, up at 4:00, 4.30, getting something to eat, hurriedly, because then I'm also taking care of my grandmother and getting her ready for the day before I leave and then headed out to the boat.  Because normally I make my lunch the day before or it's literally a protein bar, a banana and something else that I just grab and run with, and then go meet him.


If I'm lucky, he'll pick me up at the co-op and I don't (inaudible).  (laughter) And then on the boat and getting the bait bags ready as we're heading out and getting everything else, the crates ready for the lobsters, the other little crate by the water tank for the selects, just helping him out.


So that way some of the other things he doesn't have to worry about.  And then if I'm not on the boat, then it's waking up, getting myself ready, getting my grandmother ready for the day.  And I do have some cleaning jobs that I have right now, so then I leave about 8:00, 8:30 and headed off to go clean for however many hours.  And hopefully we'll see if some of the interviews come into play and are a success, then I'll be working in Ellsworth, then I'll be working with families.


Q:        [18:55] Wow, that's exciting.  What's your favorite part about working on the boat?


A:        [19:00] Joking around with my dad and getting some time back that we haven't had in the past.  And kind of that connection and being out on the water.  I absolutely love being out on the water.  


Oh, and what comes up in the traps, because every trap is different and it's that adventure of just what's going to be in that one and there's so many different little creatures out there and it's fun, it's childish, it's youthful.  


Q:        [19:30] So totally.  Yeah, it's kind of like pulling up a present, especially when there's a bunch of seaweed on it and literally you’re unwrapping it.  


A:        [19:38] Exactly.  Last summer, the whole dashboard or whatever you would want to call it in the boat was covered in all of the starfish that we ended up getting.  And it just reminded me a lot of my childhood because I had starfish all over the place, dried crab shells all over the place.  So yeah, it's a surreal feeling, I guess.  


Q:        [20:06] Totally.  And the dynamic that you have with your dad is probably really special, too.


A:        [20:12] Absolutely.  Yes, for sure.  Because we can joke around and but then also know that there's a job to be done.  And he's actually taught me a lot since being on the boat.  He did say I was a fast learner so maybe it's just in my blood.  Yeah, it's fun.  It's fun to be out there.  And actually I miss it when I'm not out there.  I don't always miss the bait smell, but – (laughter)


Q:        [20:41] Totally.  How do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing sector, including how others perceive or treat you?


A:        [20:51] So I think my background, it hasn't been easy.  And I've had to work a good majority of my life.  Things were a little different when I was married.  But growing up wise, I had to be strong.  And I think in this industry, you do need to be strong.  And you need to have to work.  You want to have to work, because it's physically laboring.  It's not – like my son just started.


And the other day he was talking to me and he said, there's a lot to this.  And I said, Yeah, it is, buddy.  He goes not just physically but you really have to be paying attention to everything.  And I'm like, yeah, you do.  It's like there's a lot of elements here.  I said, there is.


So yeah, and I forgot part of the question that you asked.  (laughter)


Q:        [22:02] That's great.  If it guides you somewhere, that's awesome.  The question was, how do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing center, ppsector, including how others perceive or treat you?  


A:        [22:14] So yes, I do.  I think you have to want to be a hard worker.  Be strong.  And I feel like part of my desire to be part of this is just from my background because I remember my grandfather and my grandmother coming in.  I used to run down to the wharf when I knew they were coming in to meet them, to meet my dad at times.  So this was later on in life meeting my dad.  Yeah.


So it's just, it's a comfort feeling.  It's – yeah.


Q:        [22:49] Totally, like you said, it's in your blood.


A:        [22:50] I guess so.  Yeah.


Q:        [22:54] How does your role in the fishing sector work with your family or caregiving responsibilities?


A:        [23:01] I don't really, I mean, it just, there's no really effect.  It just all works.
It just blends and we all, I mean, we all understand that I guess.  And I still learn  things every day that I, that I don't know because I have been away and just coming back into this area newly wise recently.


So yeah, I don't, I don't really think it has any effect except for the fact that it just
kind of puts us all on the same page and we kind of understand where we’re all coming from.


 Q:        [23:37] Sounds good.  All right.  I'm going to shift to questions here towards environment changes. Can you describe any changes in the marine environment that you've noticed?


A:        [23:53] And I have to be politically correct.  


Q:        [23:55] You don't have to be.


A:        [23:59] Oh, so of course you hear a lot about environmental factors from the news and everything.  I don't always agree with all of that.  And I feel like sometimes the fishing industry is under attack and I don't think it's right.  And I feel like some of the sciences that are out there that they're not genuine and it's not, it's not right.
It's not fair.  I think in this aspect with any job before making assumptions or conclusions, you really need to be going to the source and asking questions and seeing what is going on.  Because just going out there for somebody that doesn't really know what's going on, you can't make those assumptions and putting them out there nationally because then it just makes a huge chaotic mess when certain things aren't really going on.


Q:        [25:22] How do those changes impact your work?


A:        [25:27] So there's a lot more regulations that are out there at this point – our to do lists that are out there at this point.  And then I have heard that there's even more on the forefront that they may have to be dealing with.  And in the end, it really does cause a lot more headache for these fishermen to have to deal with.  And it could also start to kind of minimize this whole industry.  And there's a lot of fishermen in this industry and it's sad to think that their livelihood could be cut short because of unnecessary changes.


Q:        [26:20] Have you noticed this frustration with most fishermen that are part of the co-op or your dad or  –


A:        [26:29] Almost every fisherman that I've talked to, yes, they all voice the same concern.


Q:        [26:36] Is there anything you've tried or have seen people try in response to cope or adapt to these changes?


A:        [26:45] I think some people are just trying to do the best that they can.  I know that I did help out a fisherman over in Winter Harbor.  He was not technically savvy whatsoever, so I would end up helping him with his daily  –


Q:        [27:08] Landings?  


A:        [27:09] Yes, it wasn't the landings though.  It was the new VTR system that they have out there, the VTR number.  So I would end up helping him with that because he had no idea how to do it because he's older and he's not from a generation that dealt with tablets and phones and all that stuff.  As for some of the other guys, they're just trying to get through it as much as they possibly can just to stay within compliance.


Q:        [27:48] Have you, are there any other kinds of resources or training organizations out there that you've seen that help people with learning how to navigate the new regulations?


A:        [28:00] I do know I was speaking with one gentleman from DMR that he was going to be coming down to the co-op to meet with some of the fishermen to help them and guide them through a lesson per se for the VTR numbers.  Some of the other like leads of the landings reports they've been doing I guess for a while now.  So I think some of that is just old hat for the guys but some of the newer stuff coming up.  I do feel like there might be some help out there that I've seen anyway.


Q:        [28:39] What is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future of Maine's coastal fisheries and aquaculture industries?


A:        [28:55] I think my biggest concern is kind of a repeat of what I've already said is that this is a livelihood in Down-East Maine.  And once that's taken away, if it's taken away because of all these regulations and these – they're like hiccups or barriers that are being put out there every single day sometimes it seems like.  What is going to happen to it?  It's just going to close up shop and then what do all these people do? Because you've got older generations, then you've got your middle-aged generations and then you've got some of the younger generations that are coming up into this whole thing and that's where I mean you've got your older generation that are going to be retiring.  Your middle age is going to end up moving into that section of the retirement.  Then you've got your younger generations coming up which soon will be within the middle age so it's a continuous flow.  


Some of these regulations that are coming out and if they do cause so much chaos to a lot of people that I have even known a few people that have not done it per se but they've verbalized it.  I'm done.  I'm just going to throw it in.  I’m throwing the towel in.  Then your numbers are going to minimize and then what happens.
It's just going to be gone.  It's going to be a lost industry.


Q:        [30:38] Have you noticed if it affects people differently regarding how big they fish if they're like you said smaller guys or if they're a part of something a bigger?


A:        [30:55] I mean I know some guys that have multiple crew on the boat and then I know some guys that go by themselves or just have just a stern man and I guess they call it the first guy.  I don't know, politically correct or anybody that's listening to this, they're going to be laughing going she doesn't have a clue.  But I do feel like I mean everybody's had their own opinion and everybody's had their own comments about certain things and some things that's oh well whatever we're just going to keep doing what we're going to be doing until you know they shut us down, where others they gripe but then they just continue on with their day.


Q:        [31:43] If you could tell policymakers what the biggest priorities should be to help people
adapt to the environmental changes what would you tell them?


A:        [31:54] Can you repeat that again?


Q:        [31:55] If you could tell policymakers in Maine what the biggest priorities should be to help people adapt to the environmental changes what would you tell them?


A:        [32:05] I think they need to go to the source because at this point I feel like there's not a lot of people going to the actual fishermen and asking questions.  I don't feel like they are, I don't think that the correct avenues are being taken.  It's certain – I don’t want to get in trouble for saying what I’m saying  – (laughter)


Q:        [32:43] You’re OK.


A:        [32:47] I feel like there is a lot of assumptions and I feel like there is just like it's almost like somebody's just grabbing something out of the air and running with it.  Oh let's grab this for today and run with it.  And there's not really any research and there's not really any genuine scientific data that's being collected.  It's not going out on the boat.  


I believe one of the conversations going on right now is that there's not a lot of eggers is what they say.  There's not going to be a lot of reproduction.  I just went out on the boat to help get my son acclimated with it and that day that we were out there I don't know how many eggers we found and they're not all big, some of them are smaller.  So you, I mean anybody that's paying attention and that is using common sense can see that those younger lobsters, if they're already reproducing now, they have many, many, many more years to reproduce.  And it's proven right there.


So instead of grabbing something out of the air maybe or going along false research or just get on the boat, get on a boat, go out for the day and see what comes up.
And actually be part of it.  And then go with your research.  


Q:        [34:35] I think it also seems like historically lobstermen have always taken the initiative to protect and make sure that there's a good future in store in the fishery.


A:        [34:49] Yes.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I do think they do that.


Q:        [35:01] Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training or programs for the fishing industry?


A:        [35:08] No.


Q:        [35:10] What strategies do you think would be effective in building resilience against climate related impacts for fisheries?


A:        [35:16] I have no idea.  (laughter)


Q:        [35:22] Are there other –


A:        [35:23] You can skip that question.


Q:        [35:25] Are there other types of changes that are impacting your work that you want to tell us about?  So not just environmental, but it could be access to working waterfront or changes in demographics or –


A:        [35:48] Well, I know like with the storms, I do feel like there are environmental changes that are happening.  But I do think it's natural environmental changes that are happening.  Like I have noticed that the tides just seems so much higher than what I ever remembered.  So with that aspect of things, like with some of the wharfs that were damaged and everything, I think some of the fishermen do have to take into consideration that they're going to have to build higher.  They may have to make them a little bit sturdier.  Now some of the other access – I'm totally getting lost in my thought.  (laughter)


Q:        [36:48] That’s good.


A:        [36:49] No, it’s not good because I forgot what I was even talking about.


Q:        [36:54] You were talking about the changes that you've noticed and how people are adapting to them.  So you said –


A:        [37:01] OK, yeah.  Yeah.  I would just keep it at that, because other than that, I don't really – I'm trying to think of like some of the things my dad's mentioned.  But some of the other things I don't – I mean, that's just one thing I've noticed is the tides.  I do think some stuff with some of the changes that are going on.  Like I said, I think they're natural.  But then some of the other changes that are going on, I don't really know what's going on.  I can't put my finger on it, but I don't trust them.  I don't trust it because some of it just doesn't seem possible for some of this stuff.


Q:        [37:43] Like what?  


A:        [37:45] You already know where I'm going with this.  (laughter) That's why you ask me like what?  Like a lot of these – a lot of the sea life that are just coming up dead.  It's weird how some of this stuff is going on.  But then you wonder if it's even true because – sorry, but I feel like you can't trust the news nowadays.  You're not getting a news report.  You're getting a – how can we conform these people into thinking the way that we want to think?  How can we make a bunch of activists out of a topic to have more numbers to be able to be against a certain thing?  


That's what I can't put my finger on.  And it drives me crazy sometimes because I just wish that I could put my finger on it.  Because it's too weird that all of a sudden certain things are happening.  Who knows?  I mean, it could be that the whales are just time – it's their time to go.  That some of the fish that are popping up, it's just their time to go.


But then there's other parts that I'm like some of it doesn't make sense.  And again, like I said, is it real or is it just a news report that's not real?  


Q:        [39:40] That's hard to navigate.


A:        [39:41] Yeah, absolutely.  No pun intended.  (laughter)


Q:        [39:46] Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes you've experienced in the industry during your time?


A:        [39:53] And some opportunities or positive changes?  You know, I think I wouldn’t – I don't know if I would say any opportunities, but I would say the positive changes. It does seem like everybody's on board together.  And they are – in it is one, all of the fishermen are pretty much in agreeance with each other.  And I think that's where I kind of get like goosebumps a little bit about it because that's where the community comes involved.


And that's where they come together and work together and fight together for something that obviously is a love for a lot of these guys and women.  


Q:        [40:51] Totally.  Have you noticed more participation among women?


A:        [40:58] Absolutely.  Yes, definitely.  And I think it's actually kind of cool because it is fun out there.  And let’s enjoy it.  I enjoy it.  That's what really honestly a job is all about.  You need to enjoy what you're doing.  And I think with some of the women to have the confidence to get out there, especially captains of the boat.  I mean, I – kudos to them because I think it's awesome.  But yeah, I think it's a great thing to have the women – a lot more women coming into this industry.  For one, I think it can kind of provide a different aspect for some of the outsiders as well that it's possible and it's happening.


Q:        [41:55] Totally.  That's exciting.  What is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine’s coastal fisheries?


A:        [42:04] I hope it can remain as is, old school.  I mean, granted, everything changes.
I get that.  But let's not put so many regulations down and have so many changes that you make it impossible for these people to do their job.  Many of these guys, many of these women have been getting up every day for years.  And this is – again, I mentioned it before, this is their livelihood.  So it needs to continue on so that way they can continue on with their livelihood.  And then also be able to have some of these younger generations be able to carry that through.  I mean, these are family generations that are going to be continuously passed down.


Q:        [42:59] Is there anything else you wanted to share?


A:        [43:02] I don't think so.  (laughter) Because I feel like it's been all – a mess already. (laughter)


Q:        [43:08] It's been wonderful.  Thank you, I’ll stop the recording


END OF FILE"
"6","Q: [0:00]        And if we could just begin with how you like to introduce yourself.


A: [0:05]        Yeah, cool.  Well, hi there.  My name is Libby Davis.  I'm the owner, operator, and founder of Lady Shuckers, mobile raw bar and event company.  It's a food truck and event catering company based out of Portland, Maine that sources from women-owned sea farms.  


Q: [0:20]        Great.  And can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A: [0:25]        Yes, so I'm a Maine native.  I grew up in Scarborough, born and raised about 10 minutes south of Portland.  And yeah, I grew up in my neighborhood.  It was like on a salt marsh, the Nonesuch River.  


        And so, yeah, growing up – I actually really didn't like seafood growing up, but my family did.  And my mom and her friends would always cook lobsters.  And my dad would always get a recreational clamming license and go down the end of the street.  And we'd dig for clams.  And yeah, even with the neighborhood kids, we'd go down there and find treasures in the marsh and bring them back, broken bottles and stuff.  


        But it's really funny to all my family now that I work in the seafood sector because I actually didn't care for it much as a kid.  Like the smell, I just didn't really like it.


Q: [1:07]        Great.  And can you tell me where your parents are from and what they did?


A: [1:11]        Yeah, so my mother, she's from outside of Boston, the North Shore in Revere, Massachusetts.  And yeah, she's an account manager.  Works for like a gourmet food international company.  She's an account manager for like Hannaford, like works on getting specialty cheeses and meats, deli products into their stores.  


        So I've kind of always had that food industry-adjacent sector growing up.  She would go to shows and bring home samples and stuff.  We'd always be trying stuff. 


        And then, yeah, my father is – has been self-employed my whole life.  He's a residential, remodeling contractor and works primarily doing basements, kitchens, bathroom, remodels, not so much additions anymore.  But yeah, mostly in the greater Portland area.


Q: [2:00]         Great.  And do you have any siblings?


A: [2:01]        I do not.  Just me myself and I, yeah.  


Q: [2:04]        And do you have any history of fishing in your family?


A: [2:08]        Well, so my dad grew up on Peaks Island.  And he used to lobster a lot as a young man.  Not really so much commercial fishing.  We would go on like bass fishing trips and stuff like that, but not really any like deep sea-like fishing of that sort.  


        But definitely the sea is in his side of the family's blood.  And it's in my blood too.  And that's actually where him and my mom met was on Peaks Island, when she  finally moved up here.  They met at the Dry Dock bar right on Commercial Street.  They're not together anymore, but they have a great relationship.  (laughter)


Q: [2:47]        Great.  Thank you.  And do you have any family history of working in other roles in the fishing industry?  So maybe that could be bookkeeping, processing, marketing.  Anything like that?


A: [3:00]        I don't know so much in the fishing industry, but I have like a lot of agricultural experience.  I studied biology in school.  I went to this small hippie school in Vermont and wanted to pursue like wildlife biology.  And then kind of learning about the synergy between wildlife and humans.  


        I actually decided to go into the Peace Corps.  And I served for three years in Madagascar as an agriculture food security volunteer.  And Madagascar is a beautiful island off the coast of Africa.  And a lot of the villages I worked in and the villages I lived in were fishing villages.  


        And basically what we were doing there was trying to grow new crops.  Trying to teach about sustainability.  Trying to teach about co-op and organizational structure.  About how folks could have some financial resiliency.  And about how they could kind of diversify the supply chain and get those products into other markets.  Because it's very kind of remote place to try and do business in.  Pretty much all the business that was being done in a very rural place like Madagascar was agribusiness.


        So yeah, that was a very formative experience for me.  It's funny that it’s like doing what I do now, working with oyster farmers, that that experience maybe kind of set the stage for what I do now a little bit.


Q: [4:23]        Awesome.  Are you married?


A: [4:27]        Not married.  No.


Q: [4:29]        Do you have any children?


A: [4:31]        No children.


Q: [4:31]        Great. So we're going to transition to your role in the sector, starting with how would you describe your role in the fishing or aquaculture industry in Maine?


A: [4:42]        Yeah.  I feel like I wear many hats in the aquaculture sector in Maine.  It kind of came about in this really like kismet an organic way where I came back from Peace Corps.  I served there 2015 to 2018 and I got right into working at a raw bar when I came back..  


        I didn't really know what I was going to do with my life after such like a transformative experience there.  I felt kind of like a stranger in my home turf a little bit.  


        And yeah, I met an individual who had just opened up this oyster bar in town.  The oyster bar’s called Maine Oyster Company and the individual's name is John Herrigel, who's the owner-operator.  


        And I started managing that oyster bar and I just kind of fell in love with the product.  I fell in love with like the sustainability story of it.  I love to tell like oysters were good for human health and environmental health. 


        And yeah, at the time the bar that I was working in, I was the only female identifying staff member there.  And I was running drinks and doing food and all this stuff.  But I really wanted to be shucking because I could see that that interface between the shucker and the patron.  Like that was where the really cool information exchange was happening about oyster farming, about oyster reproductive style, about the flavor profile, about the growing.


        So I was really dedicated and driven to kind of get my shucking skills up so that I can be in that kind of facilitator role to educate more about sustainable aquaculture to folks.  


        And I worked that job for a long time.  I met a lot of amazing people that it was kind of like an oyster clubhouse where farmers would come in.  And yeah, I forged a lot of great friendships with women and other men in the industry as well who are farmers, or outreach specialists, or just tied to policy, marine policy in different ways, and all working to kind of raise the aquaculture industry.  And unfortunately, we had this global pandemic which closed the restaurant temporarily.  


        And I transitioned back into international development work for a little bit.  Working for a carbon – a project developer that was doing like carbon offset credits back in Sub-Saharan Africa.  


        But I really just missed aquaculture so much in the community.  You know, I was working from home.  I felt kind of isolated.  And I just wanted so badly to make an impact on the industry.  And I wanted to support these people that had become like such good friends of mine.


        And so I got, yeah, this little think tank of friends together.  The Lady Shuckers Think Tank.  And we started putting some ideas down on paper, some calls about what it would be like to have this food truck.  You know?  It was kind of my kind of original concept.  Lady Shuckers and kind of doing it for ladies and just for underrepresented groups in general to try and amplify those voices and to tell those stories.  And really get the products into other markets and wider audiences.


        So yeah, 2021 kind of soft launched the company.  And I think my role – it's a marketer.  It's a marketer to tell the story of the farmers that I buy from who are out on the water.  It's kind of hard for them to always get into the public eye because they're very busy with their farms.  So I feel like I kind of have this really – I'm honored to have the role of being like a steward of their products and a caretaker of their products.  And get to bring them to people and help people experience them through a bunch of different types of experiential events.


        So we do – we have the food truck, which is kind of more like pop-ups, breweries, festivals where we do live-action oyster shucking.  We do like caviar bombs.  We have like a kelp kimchi grilled cheese.  We can do lobster roll.  


        And then we also do the private events.  We do a lot of weddings for people.


        It's been really cool to have clients come to us and say that they want to work with the company because of our values of sourcing from women or because it's queer owned, or women owned.  That's been really cool to find alignment there.  And then kind of the third aspect is these experiential events.  


        So the first partnership that we did was shucking on sailboats. And that was kind of more of like a party kind of cruise, like two-hour harbor cruise and, you know, get the breweries on board and shucking and featuring these farms.  


        And then we also do learn-to-shuck classes, which is my personal favorite, which is getting folks together to teach people how to shuck, and so to doing demonstrations and teaching folks how to open oysters so that, yeah, maybe they could have that skill for life and they’d be more motivated to buy seafood at their local market and then take them home and feel empowered to shuck them for their friends or family or something at their house.  


        So it's kind of a long answer.


Q: [9:29]        No, it's a great answer.  I really appreciate it. 


        The next question you've kind of already answered, but just in case you have anything you want to add, it’s like how did you get into that?


A: [9:36]        Yeah.  So I think just having mentors.  Like I was so just kind of fascinated by the industry as soon as I saw it.  I had never even like had a oyster before.  Maybe like once until I started working at Maine Oyster.  And it was kind of just love it first sight.  Like I just really, really – well this is kind of like a, we say feeding two birds with one scone, (laughter) and you get to like help the environment and like it's good for human health.  


        Like a lot of the great conversations I've had about different topics have been like over a plate of food, like over a plate of oysters, and they just – they really bring people together.  I think, you know, it can kind of be a little polarizing.  Either people really like them or really they don't.  


        But for the people that don't, I feel really grateful that I get to be in that position of like being a safe person for them to like want to try their first oyster, and like I always say if they try, don't like it, you know – never have to try it again.


Q: [10:40]        Great.  Thank you.  Do you have any experience in bookkeeping, bait or gear preparation?


A: [10:45]        (laughter)  Yes, now I do.  I had to learn, definitely, not really bait preparation, because that's one of them other amazing things about oysters.  You don't have to put any food or manipulate the environment, you know, that they're grown in.  They're just kind of filter feeding off the phytoplankton and algae that's in the water column naturally already, which is why they're like a very carbon neutral kind of source of sustainable protein. 


        Gear preparation.  I mean, one of the very cool things about oyster farming is that it's a pretty low barrier to entry, but there is like a lot you have to learn.  But if you can just go out there and buy the gear, there's a lot of information online.  Or if you had the privilege to be, you know, kind of in the hotspot like I was where there was a lot of folks around who would teach you, you can kind of hone in on that local knowledge of what's worked best for other people about how to build the gear.  


        Most folks in the Casco Bay area growing in floating bag culture, which requires taking these plastic mesh bags and kind of folding them into these boxes and using like a hog ring, which is a small metal ring that you have some pliers to kind of build the box of it.  


        So yeah, you just kind of learn as you go.  I mean, honestly, I think there's a couple really wrong ways to do it, but there's no – I don't think anyone's figured out like the perfect right way to do it.  I mean, maybe they figured out the perfect right way to do it for them.  That works for them and the environmental conditions of their site.  But that's one reason why I love it too is because it can be very unique based on, you know, where you're farming.


Q: [12:28]        And how do you make your connections with your farmers?


A: [12:31]        So that's interesting to try and really think about.  I mean, I was kind of just in it for a long time.  I just had again, like the privilege of just kind of being there on the ground level when I feel like it was really taking off and getting really hot again.  And yeah, I just kind of, I just got to be there and just really got to like listen to people and hear what the needs were.  


        And, you know, one of the best things I heard at the time when I wanted to start a farm right off the bat was, well, that's great, but who's going to buy your product?  And so I think that's kind of really where Lady Shuckers came into play too as a buyer of shellfish was kind of like, OK, well, I really want to create this market for farmers and I want to be able to purchase product.  I want to be able to give them money and support their farms and support their businesses with kind of this underlying social mission.


        And so I think the farmers that felt aligned with that goal, they kind of came to me and I'm just grateful that coinciding that a lot of these folks that I buy from have been friends of mine for the last like seven years – six, seven years.  


Q: [13:49]        Awesome.  And what is sort of the geographic range of farms you buy from?


A: [13:54]        Yeah, so in the beginning, it was quite broad.  Have connections with folks all up and down the coast from my time in Maine Oyster Company who used to sell there as far north as, yeah, Ellsworth and Deer Isle and South Thomaston and Islesboro.  But operationally, kind of made a lot more sense as the company is based here in South Portland and, you know, my home is in Portland, and that's kind of where my base is.


        You know, as the company is still growing, it kind of made a lot more sense to, you know, source from farms that were a little near – nearby.  So the Casco Bay Area is primarily where we get product from.  Yarmouth.  Freeport.  We work with, yeah, Lanes Island Oyster, Wolfe Neck Oyster, Nauti Sisters Sea Farm, Emily's Oysters.  And we have our own farm coming online soon to have product probably next year.


Q: [14:53]        Can you talk a little more about that?


A: [14:55]        Yeah, sure.  So yeah, I always wanted to start my own oyster farm.  I mean, that was like immediately what I wanted to do.  It seemed like what I was more like suited for with my own personal experience with like just kind of labor and farming.  I didn't go to school for business, or hospitality, or I didn't work in the food industry really much at all.  


        But yeah, it felt like a huge goal to put some seed in the water last year.  I started working for Wolfe Neck Oyster Farm and really just making more trips out onto the water, out into the bay, which is very close to where I currently live.  So definitely have that privilege and that access to be able to go nearby and just get on a farm.


        But yeah, put some seed in the water last year out by Lanes Island and officially they'll be moving just a little bit over from the plot that they are now.  Had 50,000 oyster – six to eight millimeter size oyster seed in there in the floating bags.


        And yeah, they've been just kind of doing their thing, staying low all winter.  They're not that big.  But yeah, this season they'll transfer it to their forever home and keep growing and, yeah, oysters in Maine, take about like two-and-a-half, three years to get to be market size.


        So, I don't know, it's tough though.  With the – we had a record temperature year in Casco Bay last year.  So I think the oysters are growing a little faster than they would normally because there's – the water temperatures stayed warmer for longer.


        But yeah, I'm just excited to be able to supply our own, you know, operations with some product too, while still like, you know, supporting other farmers.


Q: [16:45]        Great, that's really exciting.  Can you talk a little bit more about your experience in processing and marketing and maybe like trade as well?


A: [16:56]        Yeah.  The marketing has been pretty organic, honestly.  I tried to keep my personal life and my work life separate.  But it's hard sometimes because I feel like, I’m the face – like when you're a startup, it's like you're the face of your company.  And it's also, you know, something that I love.  When you have a business, it's like your kid, you know, you can't leave it for too long or something's going to happen.


        So yeah, I feel like largely being able to just utilize some of the free tools that were available to me is where I started.  I took advantage of social media like Instagram, Facebook, not really so much TikTok, but we're coming.


        But just utilizing some of these free marketing tools to just start talking about, you know, connecting with the authenticity of my own love for why I'm doing it.  And kind of just putting it out there for people not really expecting for any outcome or to get business necessarily from it. 


        I didn't start this company to make money.  I did it because it is a passion of mine.  And I felt it was purposeful work too.  And kind of, I think through that lens, like the – you know, the leads and the collaborations have kind of come very, very organically.  


        We get a lot of inquiry through our website, but we're kind of working on, I think just a little bit of a freshen up of the brand at this point because that's really what we're building is like a whole brand that – you know, I'd like to have an umbrella that could expand, you know, to any person who identifies with the mission as what a lady sucker means to them, like throughout the country, throughout the world, you know?


        And it's been really cool to connect with like other folks like in other states who are trying to do similar, like mobile raw bar pop-ups.  Maybe not with the same mission, but who have reached out just kind of, yeah, looking up to what the company's doing and wanting to kind of follow a similar trend.  


        And for me, it's like, I think that's awesome.  It's like I want to put more content out so we can widen the pipeline and, you know, get more product through. That's really the goal there.


        But yeah, the marketing's just been about showing up authentically and, yeah, trying to align with organizations and other businesses that see the value and what we're doing.


Q: [19:27]        And do you have any experience in advocacy or community-based organization?


A: [20        I think I'm kind of natural – like I’m kind of like a natural marketer.  Entrepren – I've always just been kind of entrepreneurial, like ever since I was young.  I never feel like I fell into like boxes of, I don't know, “the path” on how it should be.  And I think the society that we live in.


        So, yeah, I mean, definitely working with like those communities in Madagascar, I think, helped with organizing people and taking pretty big concepts and breaking it down into small, manageable pieces.  Because it's a lot.  Like I'm not going to say that having this business, you know, having the farm, hiring people, you know, being my own boss, like creating boundaries with, you know, different ways you conduct yourself.


        I'm not going to say that that's like been an easy journey.  But I think if you can just trust that like it's all going to work out as long as your intentions are like in the right place, that is a big part of it.  


        And yeah, I do feel like I'm well suited, you know, for this role and I feel very supported by the industry as a whole for what I'm doing.


Q:        And what does an average day of work look like for you?


A:        Well, the company is still very small, right?  It's just me, myself and I.  I do have –  I had like four or five part time folks come on last summer to help out with shucking gigs.  


        But it is seasonal.  So our season pretty much starts in April and then goes through really November into the holidays.  And then we kind of like, you know, close down everything.  


        The food truck gets shut down and like October, it gets winterized.  But right around this time of year we're going to be opening everything up.  


        And so, yeah, typical work day for me in the off-season looks like answering e-mails.  You know, a lot of e-mail stuff.  Like I said, we're working on some new kind of rebrand concepts to get some new merchandise out there, connecting with, you know, other folks that just want to do oyster events.  


        And then there's all the not fun stuff like balancing the checkbook, and making sure the bills are paid and, you know, renewing licenses and permits and, you know, paying the bills.


        [phone rings]


        Oops, that's someone.  (laughter)


        So yeah, I mean in the on season, it looks like planning.  A lot of planning.  Getting people ready for the gigs.  I found pretty quickly in my first summer that if I tried to do everything I would get burnt out.  And anybody that's a small business owner, you know, knows that delegating like staff and having employees, you know, that's a whole other part of the job.  Making sure that they feel supported, you know, when they're going into the gigs.  Because in my opinion, every gig is an opportunity to be our best self.  


        A lot of times we're doing people's weddings, you know.  And we want it to be received well.  And we also want to make sure that the product itself is being properly cared for.  It is a raw perishable product.  And so that people feel ready for the type of things we're going into.


        So having a lot of calls with, you know, the folks that are going to be working for us, you know, putting together stuff to market on social media.  It's all calendar.  If it's not on my Google calendar, like I don't know what's happening honestly.  Yeah, a lot of planning.


Q:        Thank you.  And do you currently hold any commercial fishing licenses?


A:        I hold an aquaculture harvester license.  Yeah.  And that's pretty much it.  Yeah.  Don't have much time for much other commercial fishing.  But oystering will always, you know, be a love of mine and I hope to do it as long as my body allows.


Q:        Great.  Thank you.  And how do you feel that your background or identity shapes your work in the sector?  I'll ask you that and there's a follow up question to that.


A:        Yeah.  I mean, honestly, I feel like it works for me.  Because I'm not just talking to talk.  Like I feel like I walk the walk too.  


        You know, I'm not just doing this for like Internet points or for, I think kind of like the – the materialistic or the external things.  Like I'm doing it because I truly believe in the industry.  I believe in the power of the community we have here in Maine.  


        I want to create more opportunities to advance and elevate the Maine seafood brand, especially as we see, you know, the lobster are kind of golden child.  The lobster fishery kind of diminish.  And, you know, that fishery kind of having some issues with different environmental things.  And harvesters having to move farther, farther offshore to meet their demands.


        You know, I see the oyster as a very accessible option for us to piggyback off of in the Maine seafood industry.  And you know, I've definitely lived a couple of lives.  I've used up some of my non-cat lives here on this earth.  This is so far.  But I think I got plenty to go, hopefully.  God willing.


        But yeah, it's really, it's really like what I love to do, you know.  I believe that it can make a difference in some of these really big issues that we're facing right now.  Like climate change.  Like food insecurity.  Like – it's just going to be the key, you know, if we can all get on board and kind of work together.


        And yeah, I think being someone from Maine, it makes me feel very passionate about supporting my home.  I feel like I kind of ran from my home for a while.  I was a little bit of a traveler, a little bit of a vagabond.  And I feel really grateful to finally be making roots back here and be doing something that is so positive for my Maine heritage.


        And also as it, you know, insofar as when it comes to, you know, supporting underrepresented groups as, you know, a queer woman in the industry, it feels really good to be able to, you know, embody that and telling parts of that story that, you know, didn't always feel the easiest to talk about.  And it feels really good to be able to just kind of let go of some of the pain that might have come from that story and to be able to just put it out there for people, and to know that it's coming from like a place of like my true self, and to not feel like it has to be hidden anymore, and to see people kind of come to support that.


        It just feels really good.  It feels like I'm right where I have to be.  Right where I need to.


Q:        Great.  And do you feel like that – that identity piece – do you feel like that affects the way that others perceive or treat you in the industry?


A:        I don't think so.  Definitely, definitely not.  Definitely not.  I mean, I think no matter how you identify, you know, we have a lot of power in the now and we have like a choice every day for what we can do with like a day.  We really do like have the power to choose how we want to conduct ourselves, how we want to show up in the world.


        And so I think through a series of choices that I made throughout my life for whatever reason, I was able to perform really strong bonds with people.  And so they were – just wanted to see me succeed.  And, you know, if anything, I think, you know, by being more honest, by being more open with people about what's really going on, I've been able to like create stronger relationships with folks.  And so it doesn't feel just kind of like surface level, you know?


        Yeah.  I'm really grateful for the support.


Q:        That's awesome.  How does your role in – interact with any family or caregiving responsibilities you may or may not have?


A:        Well, my – really, like I come from a very small family.  Always felt calm, like a little sad, like as an only child, you know, I always want a brother or sister or something.  And so I think in that light, you know, anything I did in my life, like career-wise or education-wise, you know, I always had – I'm grateful to have both my mother and my father in my life and their support.  


        But, you know, it hasn't always been a walk in the park with that either, but definitely felt some pressure, like at different times, that I had to be like, you know, this excellent person.  


        And, you know, at times, it didn't feel like I could access that.  But, you know, my mom in particular has supported me like to the very end, like when I went to go to a hippie school, I wanted to join the Peace Corps, you know.  I start Lady Shuckers.  You know?  I come out, you know, whatever.  She has like been there for me, just like to the end.  


        And I'll talk about support a couple of times on this call, like really when you give a person an environment in which they can grow and just feel into like themselves and what's going to work for them, like you'll see magic happen.


        And so yeah, I think my work now in both, you know, my family dynamics, my romantic dynamics, and in my business dynamics, it's about how do I create that environment for people to feel free that they can feel into, you know, what's going to be best for them and so that they can grow and to just, you know, support them in that.


Q:        Great.  And then sort of transitioning into environmental changes.  Can you describe any changes in the marine environment you've noticed, if you've noticed any?


A:        There's more oyster farms out there.  That's for sure.  And that's, you know, kind of – can be a polarizing topic as well for some people that might not understand the real reason why they're there and, you know, why they should support it, and they’re kind of more entrenched in the, oh, you know, what's this, what's going to happen to my backyard, and, you know, kind of don't want to see it, smell it, hear it or whatever.


        If anything, coming from an environmental perspective, we've seen that in areas where the sea floor is completely barren and there's populations of different, like microorganisms or sea vegetables.  I'm thinking of eel grass right now.  You can't put an oyster farm anywhere where there's eel grass in the bay.


        And so inherently from that, you're going to have an oyster farm in a bare area and because the oysters, with their filter feeding and how they eat and filter, they're creating these whole, like, little micro climate, micro diversity hotspots.  And we've actually seen that these populations of eel grass that were once there are coming back where the oyster farm is because it's creating this whole habitat for fish and crabs and, you know, other little critters to kind of like reoccupy.


        So, if anything, I think oyster farming is helping our environment by creating this little microbiomes.


Q:        And you mentioned, um, like, much higher temperatures.  Have you seen any changes with that?


A:        Well, definitely, it's not ideal, right, for product that, you know, is eaten raw.  What it basically means is that when product comes out of the water at a little bit higher temperature, it needs to get back down to a refrigerated temperature a little bit faster.  


        And there's viruses in raw shellfish.  There's inherent, I think, risk with eating any raw or undercooked product, whether it's shellfish, or meat, or hamburger, or steak tartar, whatever it is.  There's inherent risk with eating raw product and in oysters, they have this virus called Vibrio in them.  


        And there's a couple different strains of it, and it hadn't been in Maine in a really long time, just very rare cases, but it can make you sick.  And so now we're seeing that when product comes out of the water at a little bit higher, what's already existing in the oyster, it – it – it replicates if it gets in the higher temperature.  


        And so those levels that were normally pretty low and stayed low can be getting higher without, you know, people even realizing it.  And it's not even conclusive across a whole batch, you know?  It's – it's spec – it can be very, very well within each individual oyster.  So if you pull 100 oysters out of the water at the same time, one could have the high levels and the other ones could be fine.


        And to add another level of complexity, it's even variable in terms of like who's going to get sick from it.  It has to do with people's different gut health and people's different levels of immune system.


        So it's been a little bit hard, I think, for the industry to hear in recent years that, you know, some harvesting areas that previously were not under these, what we call like Vibrio control areas, which basically just means there's – they're in a higher risk group, and they have to have a little bit more stricter protocol for post harvest handling.


        And that goes on my end too when I take them from the dealership to an event and they're in a cooler.  


        I think that's been a little bit harder to hear that, you know, these areas do have to have some stricter protocols because it just wasn't like that in the past.  But, you know, from what I've learned about screening on a whole is that it's – it's for the best and it just means that if everybody can follow this protocol, you know.  There will be less people getting sick from oysters.  And I think that's what everybody wants.


Q:        Great.  Thank you so much.  And how are those changes impacting you as Lady Shuckers? 


A:        Yeah.  I think just needing to up our – up our game a little bit more, um, making sure that stuff is being tempt regularly and often, um, especially on the warmer summer days.  


        We purchase all our shellfish through the Maine Family Sea Farm Cooperative Dealership, which I'm the vice president for – shout out Maine Family Sea Farm.


        But yeah, so basically what that means is that I can purchase from harvesters, so folks that don't have a dealer license, and they can drop off at the dealership, which basically what that is is like a refrigerated shipping container that has product in it, and it's tempt, and sanitization checks and all the product that comes in is logged in and when it comes out, it’s logged out.


        So yeah, from a Lady Shuckers perspective, it just means having people that are not me trained very well on the operations, and to not cut corners, and to have things organized. Community’s amazing and it can make us feel so supported, but with more people like involved, there can be a little bit more opportunity for error to be made. 


        So I think it's just about increasing communication and just making sure that everybody understands what's expected so that people can, you know, feel good about doing their job safely and effectively.


Q:        Great.  Yeah.  Can you talk a little bit about like what it's been like to move towards that or make those changes?


A:        Yeah, there's been some really amazing people that have worked for me.  I mean, particularly last year, which was the company's second full year in business, I could not have done it without, you know, those four or five folks that were – that were helping out, that were tapping in.  


        You know, at certain times we had three or four events going on one day.  And kind of my role as kind of the facilitator is kind of like getting every – you know, picking every – ordering everything.  Getting everything here and kind of just creating little stations of gear and product for everybody so that they know what they're supposed to do when they go in and they can just focus on doing their job correctly.


        So as much as possible, I try to take out like, oh, prep the lemons like this and do the menu like this.  It's like, I'm still at a stage where I do all that stuff for folks and have it all portioned out so that I can just send directions and send – arrive by this time, start by this time, done by this time, and just have it be very clear for people so that they can just focus on shucking the best dang oysters they can.


        And yeah, having fun with it too.  Maybe having a little fun with it because what we do is pretty fun.


Q:        Great.  And have you like made any changes to like, how you process, where you source?  Anything sort of like that, the equipment you use, when you're thinking about these environmental changes?


A:        Well, definitely like the upgrade to this space, Fork Food Lab, this just happened last year.  It used to be in a different location in Portland, which was a little closer to my house, but it wasn't near as big.  


        So just from a storage perspective, you know, we're an event company.  So we have pans, and trays, and paper products, and buckets, and little thingy things.  I don't even know what we have, but we have a lot of stuff.  All of a sudden.  And cold storage as well, finding, you know, space to store the oysters.  I don't know how much a bag of 100 oyster weighs, but probably close to like, between 30 and 50 pounds, depending.  Sometimes we get jumbos for fried oysters.  Those are, those are big.


        So just being able to have more space in general.  We've always sourced through the Maine Family Sea Farm Co-op, in accordance with state regulation.  But yeah, Fork – Fork Food Lab and the upgrade of this space to have more dry stores, to have more cold storage, and to have, I think just access for folks to get into the space.


        You know, it's as simple as having a key code entry where, you know, I can say, hey, this stuff is here for you to grab and just pop in.  You know, I don't feel like I have to be there all the time, which I think energetically is a drain that I could kind of like plug a little bit by being like, oh, is, are they going to be able to get into the space and like, is everything going to be fine?  It's like, they can get in.  They, they can just get in and do their, do their job.


        And so, yeah, definitely having the space has been huge.  As an incubator, while we're still in the startup phase, but eventually I'd really love to see us have our own like restaurant space to do events and stuff like that.  I think we could be really successful there.


        I don't know if it's in Portland.  And I don't know when it's going to happen, but hopefully it happens in the right timing.


Q:        Could you talk about like what your dream for that looks like?


A:        Yeah.  So as a queer woman, I feel like I get the benefits of like the best of both communities.  Like I have – I feel like I like get to access like, you know, my – my gals, like my – my farmers.  My – my ladies.  You know, they're – they're my – they're my homies.  And yeah, it's just been so great to have relationships with them.  And then kind of being more open, you know, online about, uh, you know, supporting queer people in the industry too, and creating visibility for –for folks in that way.


        I've been able to connect with a lot more like business owners and wanted to work with other business owners that are queer, and support, you know, different folks in – in different industries to kind of work with there.


        And I would just love to have like a queer kind of like oyster night club.  I don't drink, part of, I think, one of the reasons why this company has been successful is because I took it upon myself to get sober in the first year of starting it and realized that I kind of had a destructive past with drugs and alcohol after working in the service industry and different life things.  


        So I made decision to put that down really hard and focus on, you know, the business stuff.  If I was really going to, you know, kind of talk the talk about being this role model for folks in the industry, you know, I had to embody that in my own practice.  


        And so to circle back like, I don't – I like going to bars, but I don't really partake anymore.  But I love to dance, and I love music, and I love the performing arts.  And there's a lot of amazing just like local artists in the Portland area.  And I'd love to just like – I feel like I have such a great network of different people from different industries and different sectors who are all really good at what they do.  And I'd love to just be able to bring that together and have a space to host people, to be able to do their different creative artistic foodie things there.


        So yeah, some sort of like a oyster art nightclub that yeah, it's focused on kind of, I think, queer visibility.  Because I think as vibrant and diverse and amazing as a city Portland is, I think they're still lacking there in some regard.  And I think the city is hungry for some representation in a bar scene where maybe the focus is not drinking and partying.


Q:        Cool.  And you've talked a lot about support and how valuable support has been for you.  And I guess I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about like the kinds of support that have been most valuable, maybe thinking about resources, relationships, knowledge, training.  Those sort of things.


A:        Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, definitely Maine Sea Grant has been there for us from the jump.  That was how the company originally got started.  We applied for a small grant of funding in like a pitch, a business pitch competition that was during kind of like COVID, like looking for, you know, businesses to start ups, that come into the industry for COVID out of the pandemic and we pitched and we got funded.  And so they've been huge from the jump.


        You know, one of my best friends, Jacqueline Roubideaux, is an extension agent there and pulls us into different seaweed events and things like that.  Maine Oyster Company is my – is my alma mater.  That's where I learned about shucking.  That's where I learned about events.  That's where I learned about oyster reproductive cycles.  Where I learned about oyster farming.  It’s where I learned about business, and how to kind of run a food and beverage business.


        And yeah, John Herrigel was very integral for me in, you know, being a huge mentor for me in a lot of ways, both at the restaurant and at their oyster farm, which is located in Pippsburg, Maine that we used to, you know, take people out on farm tours and stuff like that on the boat.


        There's a couple other growers in, you know, that Freeport-Yarmouth area.  It's almost like the list is like too long, which is crazy.  But definitely Amanda Moeser, huge role model for me from the beginning.  Emily – Emily Selinger, at Emily's Oysters, they – they were like, you know, the two folks that I first kind of saw when I was in the bar of shucking, and I saw them come in and I was like, OK, like I – I could – like that could be me, like I could do that.  You know?  So they were huge expanders for me, and to just kind of coming to believe what could be possible if I really just applied myself and stuck with it.


        Just the people that get back to me quickly that when I say, hey, I need to buy like 200 oysters, like, can you do that?  And they're like, yup.  That is like a huge luxury that I have and I think it's because they know me personally.  And I'm hopeful that they see it as a benefit too for their product to be, you know, associated with our brand.  


        And I think that comes from like trust in the relationship because they know that, you know, we're going to do a good job at, you know, marketing and making sure that people walk away, you know, knowing that those are the best oysters they never had, and where can they go to find more information.  And do they do farm tours?  And, yeah, it just really feels like the right thing that I need to be doing even though, you know, the food service industry is still the food service industry and it's not always glamorous.


        But yeah, I think just this model of trying to diversify the supply chain with value-added products and services, you know, because people mostly just experience oysters right in the restaurant, but it is kind of like a picnic food when you think about it.  You know, you can just serve it up on ice in like a compostable container at like a fair or something and people are really excited about that.


        So, yeah, I think just being able to have more people come in so that we can continue to do more of what we're doing is the goal.


Q:        Great.  And as you, like, keep looking towards the future, are there any things that you're like planning to do or really want to do to sort of like, I don't know, adapt to any challenges that you see coming up or just what does that look like for you?


A:        Yeah.  I'd love to lean into a little bit more about preservation of oysters just because the company is so seasonal with events and just mean we get apparently a couple feet of snow on the ground in mid-March now.  


        So looking at, you know, smoking, freezing, you know, preserving oysters in more different ways so we can, you know, continue to uphold one sect of our company's mission, which is to, you know, diversify the supply chain.  People mostly just have them around the half shell.  And supply people with value-added products and services to be able to have, you know, a more unique and kind of out of the box way to be able to experience the products in their homes.


        So I think, yeah, just being able to bring in some more young, like entrepreneurial minds to weigh in on those topics could be really beneficial.  I mean, we have Fork Food Lab, which has so many of like the appliances and the real, like, operational stuff that we need to be able to process.  


        We just applied for – to the Department of Ag to start bottling our mignonettes and cocktail sauces and selling that to little stores who really honestly need it and they always have inquiries like people are always asking about mignonettes.  They don't know where to get them.  So partnering with people like Harbor Fish and stuff like that.  And I think being able to serve it up in a very cute kind of marketing little package could be really fun for people. 


        And we have the ability to do that with the licensing out of this space.  So being able to lean more into this space and all it kind of gives for us in the time while we're here.


Q:        Great.  And also as you look towards the future, what is sort of your biggest concern about the marine environment, looking – like thinking about the future of Maine’s fisheries and aquaculture?  


A:        Yeah.  I mean climate change is very real.  So climate change, ocean acidification, those are all things that are happening right now that I think minds are working on, but it's just not happening fast enough to really try to counteract some of the negative things that are happening unfortunately.  


        But as it pertains to climate change, the Vibrio thing is real.  I think there's been a lot of scarce throughout this day and in different parts of the country about that already.  And I'd hate for there to be this negative perception around eating shellfish raw and that, ew, it's going to make you sick.


        I think it's already there a little bit, but as much as we can do on our ends as operators and stewards to try and combat that by having good handling practices and talking about that, and creating some visibility about that through education, I think that'll help kind of diffuse spears people might have.


        And I think as far as ocean acidification goes, I mean, that's just like a more acidic ocean is bad for shell, you know, mollusks.  And oysters are one of those things that can really impact the way they grow their shells.  


        And so yeah, it can just kind of take a lot longer.  They can be less resilient to pests and things like that.  Yeah, that's – that's worrisome.  I'm very interested in pursuing and what I can in my role in oyster shell recycling and looking into more of like, you know, how that can maybe help butt against some of those ocean acidification stuff we're experiencing in the tidal mud flat areas.  I know there's a lot of larger farms that are putting shell back into the marine environment to try and remediate some of that.


        As far as any like social impacts go, you know, there are some folks right now that are talking about putting moratoriums on aquacultures.  And that's really scary to me because it just takes like one or two people to really, you know, shake things up.  


        But I want to lean into like the power we have in the industry to really come together, to again, like educate people about why this is like a very good decision for Maine and for the country and for the world and why we should continue to move in this direction, as opposed to feeding into that fear-based narrative of like, oh, you know, this is going to mar your view of your ocean side property and, you know, restrict your recreational boat activities and, you know, it's impeding on commercial fishermen.  And, you know, their – their, you know, harvest.  


        And it's just not that, you know?  There's plenty of room for everybody out there on the bay.  Of all the aquaculture leases that are approved in Maine, you put them all together –shellfish, oysters, kelp, scallops, muscles – you put them all together, it's less than 1% of the entire coastline.  So there's still plenty of area there for folks to be able to, you know, do their activities and for us to all co-exist.


        And I think, again, just education and increasing aquaculture literacy is going to be huge as an industry to get on the same page about so that we can be standardized in what we're saying.


Q:        Cool.  And then sort of transitioning to some questions about climate resilience.  Have you ever participated in any kind of climate resilience training or programs for people in the fishing industry, fishing and aquaculture?


A:        I guess not specifically about climate resilience.  I mean, my own, you know, little interest that I have about the subject matter as a whole, I've tried to pursue them.  I did – I worked on Maine's first pilot oyster shell recycling project back in 2021, where we were collecting shell from like eight different restaurants and curing them to try and put them back into the environment for ocean certification.


        But specifically, you know, a climate-based training – you know, I'm a part of this women and non-known binary aquaculture cohort right now.  I've taken the aquaculture and shared waters class, which is all about kind of like, you know, farming and life cycle safety on the water, things like that.  But in terms of climate specific, no.  And I think there's a real need for it right now for educators, which I would consider myself to be an educator.


Q:        Yeah, because my sort of follow-up question is like, what do you think would be really effective at looking at like those sort of things or strategies for climate-related impacts? 


A:        I think so much of the time it just feels like this giant issue that everybody knows is happening.  But you know, what is the real data?  What is the real data?  And I feel like the data has – it changes a lot from year to year.  I feel like there's like, it's fluctuating fast.  


        And I want to be able to feel, you know, knowledgeable about that data and about how to disseminate it to folks in a way that feels like they can do something in their own corner of the world to try and help it.  Because a lot of times at the food truck, we're having these conversations about climate – climate change.  We're having these conversations about land use.  We're having these conversations about licensing.  We're having the conversations about oysters and Vibrio.  We're having them right at the truck.  And it's such a great meeting place for people to talk about these larger issues.


        And so, yeah, I think some sort of a workshop or something about it that really, you know, gave people the information about what's going on and what they could do in their own neck of the woods to help would be very useful. 


Q:        And are there any other types of changes you're experiencing that you want to tell us about?


A:        Just like in the industry as a whole?


Q:        Sure, yeah, in your role.  Anything.  Yeah.


A:        I mean, I see a lot more younger folks coming into the industry and that's really cool.  I think, you know, representation matters.  It takes – well, I'll speak from my experience, it took me seeing someone kind of like me out there doing it to say, hey, I can do it too.  And that's what I'm trying to be for other people right now.


        And so, you know, we need people of different backgrounds, people of different races, ethnicities, you know, with different experiences to come into this industry so that we can look at these topics from a very intersectional point of view and we can try to tackle them together.  


        And I think just the more we can, again, just widen that door to let more people in and be receptive to, you know, people who might be a little bit different, to be able to, you know, really support and create change.  I think that's where we're going.  


        And, you know, there's more programming I'm seeing at the university level for folks that specifically want to pursue a career path in aquaculture.  That was not an option at the school I went to when I was, you know, in school.  I think seeing more trade programs for people to get involved in aquaculture and that, you know, you can really have a lot of opportunity to be your own boss in this industry and have a really good life.  And maybe have that work-life balance that, you know, a lot of people kind of dream of.  


        You know, in Maine, we're just – we have this amazing ecosystem resources of the coastline.  It's just – it's not accessible everywhere in the state, but for the communities that are along it, you know, that's where we should be focusing efforts of getting more people into the industry because we're going to need brilliant people and different people to handle the problems of our time and for future times.


Q:        And can you tell me about any other opportunities or positive changes you've seen in your time?


A:        It's really cool what Abby Barrows is doing up in Deer Isle.  She is trialing and working on the first plastic-free oyster farm.  So as much as oysters clean the environment and they're good for you, a lot of times in practice for them, you know, you have to take a boat.  There's plastic.  A lot of plastic that's being used.  You know, we're running a generator that uses fuel.  


        And so I really like what she's doing in terms of wanting to make a change.  And that change is to use less plastic on the farm and really have it be sustainable in practice as well as like the end user kind of experiences.  But to really have it be kind of carbon neutral.  


        And so, you know, she does things like by not using like any, you know, plastic paint on the boat, she has a solar-powered generator, solar-powered tumbler.  She has been experimenting with different gear made out of wood, made out of cork, made out of mushrooms, buoys, just really cool stuff that's super innovative.


        And the cool thing about aquaculture is that the next thing that someone could do could be like the next standard because it's so new and it's so just, I think it's just so ripe for people to kind of make these innovations and for people to catch on.


        And so I really find it very admirable that she's doing it first with her own operations entirely to prove that it's possible both financially and operationally and to then be able to put that out there for people to follow suit if they wish. 


Q:        Great.  And have you noticed any changes in women's presence, participation or status in your time?  


A:        There's a lot more women getting into oyster farming I've seen over the last seven years, which is cool to say.  


        Yeah, when I first started working for Maine Oyster in 2018, I think there was only like – I think there was only like 10 or 12 women-own farms, you know, women – and these are lease holders and LPA holders too.  Now there's at least double that.  About 15% of the farms in Maine are owned and operated by women.  And even though I think that's great, it's better than zero, it's still a very small percentage.


        This is a historically dominated cis white-male dominated industry here in Maine.  Fishing.  And so I think it is helping.


        I think women – there's a couple of things that women do really well in business, and I think marketing is one of them.  And I think as long as we can keep showing up in those spaces that we're already good at, it's going to continue to create these ripple effects in the spaces that, you know, maybe we need a little bit of work in.


        And I'm just hopeful that, you know, the people that really need to hear this information, you know, can hear it because there's enough space for everybody out there.  And like I said, we're going to need a lot of people, different people that maybe have not historically been involved in the industry to come together to tackle these issues that we're all facing as a collective.


Q:        And what is sort of your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        Yeah, I'm – kind of already happening.  I mean, really, it's so moving to me and humbling to me that Maine is a part of the conversations in the forefront of the conversations at these aquaculture conferences we go to, you know, and not just from a farming and operational perspective, but from like a diversity, quality, inclusion and perspective too.  And just about what works, you know?  Alaska's in there too, but Maine is definitely in the conversation.  


        And I think it's because of support, like institutions, like the Maine Aquaculture Associations and then, you know, these cooperatives that are coming together and, you know, the individual owner-operators too that are all kind of doing their own thing and their own lane, but like have these connections that kind of expand into, you know, just across different sectors.


        I think it's buzzing right now.  Like I think Maine and aquaculture is really buzzing.  And I hope that it's just going to continue to get better and better, you know.  


        From the Lady Shuckers standpoint, you know, I'd love to be able to franchise out with the name and, you know, have little shuck shacks all over different places and all kind of sourcing those Maine oyster products and getting them into other places where, you know, they could – the price point could be a little higher into the Floridas, into the Vermonts, into the Bostons, into the New York Cities to just continue to, you know, elevate and advance the Maine Sea food brand and, yeah, really give money to these farmers.


        I think supply is definitely still getting there.  I think for a long time that was the question just because the turnover.  You know, you have to wait two-and-a-half, three years to have your product.  But I think the supply is starting to get there.


        I – it's my hope that regulation will continue to be supportive of these advances and want to move people's lease applications along quickly while also, you know, keeping in mind that, you know, we want to grow sustainably.


Q:        Great.  And is there anything else you wanted to talk about with us before we end the interview?  


A:        I'm just really happy to be a part of it, that you guys, you know, felt valuable to hear the contributions that, you know, I've made to the industry and that Lady Shuckers has made to the industry.  It's, yeah, it's just truly so humbling to be here.


        So thank you for wanting to, you know, put my voice as part of this product.  And I hope that my voice, you know, kind of represents a lot of other people that are affiliated with the business who have helped to get me here too.  So thank you.


Q:        Great.  Thank you so much.  And Jesse, you have any questions before I turn up recorder?


F:        Yup, you guys got it all.  (laughter)


Q:        Great.  Thank you so much.  I'll stop this.


END OF FILE"
"7","Q:        [0:00] We like to get started with how do you like to introduce yourself.


A:        [0:05] I introduce myself as Eden.  I use she/they pronouns.  Prefer they, but I will respond to she.  That’s kind of it.  It's usually just my name.  I don't know what else.  I live in Portland.  I've been in Maine my whole life.  I've been at Bangs Island Mussels for a little over three years now, and at this point, I am the land manager.  So, kind of exciting.  I don’t know.


Q:        [0:47] Great.  We'll move into all of those different things soon.  What year were you born?


A:        [0:52] 1998.


Q:        [0:54] Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:57] My family moved around a lot, but I went to school in Cape Elizabeth, and then my family lived partially there, and then I spent a lot of my other childhood in Gray/New Gloucester, so mostly Southern Maine.  


Q:        [1:17] Can you tell me a little bit about your parents, what they did when you were growing up or now?


A:        [1:21] They had my brother and I when we were pretty young, so they were – my mom was a waitress, and my dad was in construction.  They ended up getting divorced, but then my dad and his new wife started a business doing horticulture for the most part.  So, they do a lot of plant stuff, but in commercial offices, and that is – it's been going for like 15 years or so, and now my dad is a commercial trucker.  So, a lot of movement.


Q:        [2:02] You mentioned a brother.  Can you tell me a little bit about your siblings?


A:        [2:05] I have two.  I have one younger brother that is 24 – Caleb.  He's a delight.  Then my other brother is Benjamin, and he is 13, so quite a bit younger, but they're great.  My brother, the older of the two, Caleb, he's moving down from Bath next week to live in the Scarborough area, so it'll be nice to have him a lot closer.  They're really fun.  They're really cool.  They're good kids.  


Q:        [2:40] What does Caleb do?


A:        [2:42] He's autistic, so he has been trying out different careers and stuff, trying to find a comfy place.  He’s felt very secure at the Walmart warehouse.  He's been doing night stocking.  He’s been doing that for a while, and he really enjoys it.


Q:        [3:03] Do you have any history of fishing or aquaculture in your family at all?  


A:        [3:08] Not entirely.  A lot of passive fishing.  My dad's family has done a lot of just going out fishing on the weekends kind of thing.  That was a lot of what we did growing up.  Then, my mom's side of the family – they're centered around Boothbay Harbor area.  They are a fairly long line of shipbuilders.  They had founded – it was Stevens and Goudy at one point.  Now it's Washburn and Goudy, but they were building boats for a wicked long time.  So, not necessarily fishing but trying to help.  But a little bit.


Q:        [3:55] Yeah.  Can you talk a little bit more about that?  If that was something you experienced a lot in your childhood?  


A:        [3:59] Yeah, not too, too much.  My grandfather – well, I can't say that.  I've been on the water my whole life, but my grandfather – he's been building boats since he was fresh out of high school.  It was just something – he knew that that was what he wanted to do.  We spent a lot of time around their house.  The property has a couple of boats that are half sunk into the ground and a couple that are like project things that have been projects for 20 years.  It's always just kind of been a very – we’re on the water all the time.  My grandfather's side of the family has a cabin on Heron Island, which is just off of Rutherford Island/Boothbay Harbor area.  That's been in his family since 1911.  That we go to every year.  They're the caretakers.  I've spent most of my childhood out on the water helping them, lifting things, replacing shingles, doing weird house tasks.  A lot of just handiwork stuff, but it's really fun.


Q:        [5:19] Can you tell me about any really impactful memories from your childhood of being on the water? 


A:        [5:22] I don't know of anything that's too particular, so much as I just remember it was always a very happy place for me.  I think I always enjoyed being either on the water or swimming.  I think, having spent so much of my childhood on the ocean, there's a part of me that will always just feel at home.  There were a couple times that were – you're out, and the water's crazy choppy or something, and you're a child, and you're like, “I don't know.  I'm not in control, but somebody else might be.”  But there was a couple times that made me recognize that outside of the romanticized idea of the beach and sailing and stuff, there are elements to the water where you have to be careful.  I think that that more so stuck with me than I think – I mean, the enjoyment always does, but that was a – we got to be thinking about things outside of what's presented, I guess.  Yeah, I think that was probably most of it.


Q:        [6:45] Can you describe your educational background?


A:        [6:48] I went to Cape for elementary, middle, and high school.  I did not go to college.  Wanted to, but it didn't work out that way.  I did a couple of years on and off at SMCC, so community college classes, just trying to get a couple things taken care of if I ever wanted to transfer.  But in that time, I had switched up whatever career path I was following a few times.  I did a lot of medical assisting for a couple years, and then a couple of years, I did criminal justice.  It was a little all over the place.  I stopped that just before COVID, and I have worked here since COVID, so not too, too much, but I'm hoping to get back into it whenever I can find the time.


Q:        [7:48] Great.  Thank you.  And then just a few more demographic questions before we sort of transition.  Are you married?  


A:        [7:52] No.  


Q:        [7:53] Do you have any children?  


A:        [7:54] No.  I have a cat.  He's basically my child. (laughter)


Q:        [7:58] That’s a child, for sure.  Sort of transitioning to your role in the sector, how would you describe your role in the fishing and/or aquaculture sector in Maine?


A:        [8:08] Mostly production management, I would say.  So the farm that we work on – mussels, most part.  We also do kelp.  I am in the mussel part almost entirely.  We are harvesters and distributors.  That means that we harvest, and then we also ship to customers.  I do the shipping, packaging of things.  The room that I'm in, it's a lot of big machinery.  So it's just a lot of keeping track of machines, keeping track of numbers, that kind of thing.  Yeah.


Q:        [8:55] How did you get into this work?


A:        [8:59] It was a little serendipitous.  I was working for a bank that offers – there’s a competition that they do for local small businesses that have a sustainability drive, and it's a grant competition.  One year, I had gone just to watch because I was curious.  Matt, the owner, was presenting that year, and I remember – sweet job – and two or three years – and I'm like – I got to try it.  It worked out, and I started part-time on the production team, and now I'm the manager of it.  It was definitely one of those – it gave me a direction to go down.  I'm really fortunate that it worked out that way.  


Q:        [9:47] Can you remind me how many years you have been working here?


A:        [9:51] Three.  It was three in March.  Yeah, it's been very fun.  It's been very fun the whole time.


Q:        [9:58] Did you have a moment that hooked you or where you knew, “Oh, I want to keep doing this?”


A:        [10:03] As soon as I realized I didn't have to do any customer service, it was an absolute game changer.  Growing up, I had wanted to be a marine biologist, which takes a lot of extra steps, but I was always told no, there's not enough money in that field.  It worked out that I got this job.  I felt like, “Oh, I can just control my circumstances.  I don't have to worry about interacting with too much of the public.”  I did a lot of service work up until this point, and it was really nice not to. (laughter)


Q:        [10:42] Can you describe for me what an average day might look like for you here?  


A:        [10:47] It’s a little split up during the week.  Right now, we're back at our processing and harvesting time.  Mondays and Wednesdays is when we do our harvest.  We harvest during the day.  Then we process at night.  I'll come in on those days at noon.  We get all of our boxes set up for shipping – tags, labels, everything set up.  A lot of it is dependent on information that they have at the water.  We keep track of this line off of this raft – put here.  It's making sure that that's all coordinated.  Then we process from 1:00 to 11:00, maybe midnight sometimes.  We're getting out at 10:00 right now, which is really nice.  That’s cleaning the mussels, running the machines, packing up orders, getting all that squared away, and sending out invoices to customers – stuff like that.  


Then on the off days like today, restocking any of the bags I used last night, tidying things up, and then a lot of it is paperwork, a lot of making sure that all of our mussels are tracked because we had a – first time ever, but we had a recall earlier this week or last week rather, and we were able to get back everything that we had sent out.  It was recalled after we had packed and shipped everything, which was stressful, but we were able to get back everything except for four pounds.  I know where those four pounds were sold from, so at that point, it's up to them to figure it out.  We were able to get that coordinated so quickly because a lot of my off time is spent plugging in information.  I enjoy doing that.  That's most of my week.  Then just housekeeping tasks, making sure that machines are lubed up and running properly.  We've done a couple of major overhauls on our machines this year.  So, keeping things running smoothly.


Q:        [13:11] Yeah.  You mentioned this season.  Can you describe a little for me, maybe the way your work varies by season?  


A:        [13:17] Yeah.  In theory, mussels are year-round.  Right now, April, May, June of every year, there's a red tide bloom.  I found out recently that Casco Bay has a higher probability of being impacted by red tide than most of the rest of the coast.  I'm not exactly sure why, but something that hits us pretty regularly.  We didn't have it last year.  The year before, we did.  It’s hard to predict, but that will close us down.  I think the year before last we were closed for two and a half months, and then last year we weren't closed at all.  It depends on – we do weekly or biweekly testing.  No.  Two tests a week – that's the word – to make sure that toxicity levels are where they should not be.  


Then, there's also certain times of the year where in the colder seasons, so fall through – usually October to April, when there's more storms, the seas are a bit more chaotic.  Mussels will put more of their energy towards their byssal threads, which are what keeps them secured to things, than they will to their shell growth or their body growth.  A lot of the stuff that we get in that time will be a bit smaller, higher breakage, doesn't grow as quickly.  Sometimes, if we're getting down to a point where nothing really looks ready, we'll close for a couple weeks just to let things pop back up.  We did that last month, I believe.  We just got back recently.  It depends on the year, but you can usually bet that beginning of summer and maybe the last month of the year, we might take some time off.  But otherwise, it is year-round. (laughter)


Q:        [15:31] Can you describe to me from the very beginning of the process, the tiniest mussel, all the way through it being shipped out?


A:        [15:40] Yes, for the most part.  I'm still trying to figure out what the water crew does out there other than mess around. (laughter) We will either seed our mussels or we catch them natural set.  We have more success with the natural set.  They grow on large rafts.  We have large rafts set up throughout the bay, a couple of different locations, and then each one has two to six rafts at each one, and the rafts are 150 feet long on each one of them – tied on is a 37-foot piece of – it's a rope that – it’s kind of like loose fiber so that there's more surface area for mussels to settle on to.  That's where they grow.  


Either we will set those lines bare, and then we can predict throughout the year when there's spawning events, so we can anticipate, like, “Oh, if we set them this week, they'll probably set for the month.”  Or if we are seeding as we're harvesting mussels, we'll grade out the small stuff that isn't up to market size, and then we'll take that and send it through a machine that – I describe it as sausage maker.  It’s a cotton sock that we put over a funnel, essentially, and then just funnel mussels through into the sock, and then that will degrade in the water, but at that point, the mussels will have clung onto the line that we've strung through it.  


Those lines set differently if they're natural or if they're seeded, so I prefer the natural lines.  They do a better job at getting themselves oriented in a consistent way, whereas the seeded ones have a tendency to bunch up here, bunch up there.  I don't know how they managed to do it, but mussels have a way of knowing how to set themselves up for success.  I enjoy that.  


The water crew will go out and those lines they'll haul.  They have a smaller version of the machines in my room on the boat, so they run it through a de-clumping machine that breaks apart the large clumps.  Then there's a grading table that they have so they can get out most of that seed.  Then, they load it into big bins called Xactics.  We'll usually do eight to 10 of those a night.  Each one can hold up to 700 to 1100 pounds or so, and that's raw product.  


So, they'll bring that back here.  They get back around noon or 1:00, and then that's when my team comes in, and we'll bring everything into our processing room, and it goes through a horseshoe of machines, but it will be dumped into one hopper.  It goes up through there, and then it goes into a de-clumping unit that has a built-in grater.  It’s almost like a jaw, essentially.  And the open part of the jaw is where mussels fall into.  In the jaw are rotating brushes with harder plastic spikes, essentially.  Those will cling to the bits of the byssal thread and tear that from itself so that they're easier to – we don't want them clumped up.  


Those will fall into the grading unit.  We'll get all that seed out.  They go back up into another machine that's our debysser.  We have very technical terms.  That is set up.  It's also a series of rotating bars and that pulls the byss out.  They get graded again to get all of the final seed out, and then they go onto our inspection table, and that's where we have a team of four people on a conveyor belt with lights and water and everything set up, and they'll hand inspect the mussels from there.  The machines do a really good job of getting everything cleaned and graded out to size, but we'll have people on to pull out anything broken or hairline fractures on it.  It's an opportunity for bacteria to get in, so making sure that everything is a mussel that you would want on your plate.  We get some interesting stuff on there, so making sure that no stray anemones make their way into a bag.  


Then, stuff gets bagged up.  We do two-pound bags and 10-pound bags, and then we tag them, pack them into either shipping containers or different vessels for our local customers.  We'll ice them, pack them up, and then the following morning, they get sent down to Araho, which is a distribution center in Boston.  From there, they make their way.  It’s quite the journey.  We do a lot up and down the East Coast, but we do have quite a few like Mid and West Coast customers.  One of the recall customers – or from the recall the other day – bags had been already sent to a restaurant in Vegas, so they had to send those back.  I didn't realize they had somebody in Vegas who ate our stuff.  So, that was kind of cool.  


Q:        [21:50] What are the edges of your range?  


A:        [21:53] I'm still trying to figure it out because it mostly – we distribute to mostly – we distribute to distributors, I guess.  A lot of our customers are fish shops who have their own clientele.  We will have a large company based out of Colorado, but they will get 600 pounds twice a week, and from there, they'll split it up between any of the restaurants in their area or the shops and stuff.  I'm still trying to figure out if the large distribution is in Colorado, where outside of Colorado are they going?  Do they go past it?  I don't know.  I think beyond finding out about Vegas, which was really cool, we had a customer in Idaho, a lot of people in Florida, and most of the southern coast.  But a little ways.


Q:        [23:04] How long does it take a mussel to get to the point where it can be processed and shipped out?  


A:        [23:11] Ideally, from when it gets seeded down – I want to say a year and a half, two years or so from spawn.  We also have a remote settlement facility where we take microscopic spawn and attach it, in theory, to lines that will set out.  That's something that we've been trialing a bit these past couple years with a pretty OK success rate.  From there, it's about two years or so.  If we're doing natural set, it's the same situation where it's spawn.  That's also about two years.  The seeding is a bit of a shortcut because, at that point, they’re already – you can see them at that point.  I think if we seed things down, we can expect to have it in six months, maybe a year, depending on the size.  But a lot of the stuff that we're harvesting now is stuff that we had set in the end of 2022.  A lot of it is preparing in advance for – are we going to have – if we're seeding now, we’re anticipating having that be for maybe 2026, so longevity, ideally.


Q:        [24:36] Do you have a sense of scale of the company?


A:        [24:42] Sort of.  


Q:        [24:44] How much product do you move in a year?


A:        [24:49] A lot. (laughter) I actually just did a lot of these numbers the other day because I was interested.  The year, we will do two harvests a week and two harvests a week, each one is five to 7000 pounds.  We can safely do 12 to 14,000 pounds a week.  If everything works out and we don't have red tide, that would be every week of the year.  It's not always the case.  I would say, if we’re doing comfortable numbers, probably 50 maybe – at least 50,000 pounds a year, I would say.  I don't have it off the top of my head, but we had figured out – we have a way of figuring out exactly how many individual mussels we process in a year because we count how many mussels there are per pound, and we keep track of that.  It was some ridiculous number.  It was like six million something.  We moved quite a bit of product.


Q:        [26:11] Yeah, wow, that's amazing.


A:        [26:13] It's great.  It's really cool.  It's also jarring sometimes because you don't realize, like, “Oh, I'm wheeling around a container that has 1000 pounds of mussels in it,” and that's 1000 pounds of like an animal that's in here.  It’s interesting to think about sometimes.  I like it.


Q:        [26:34] Great.  I'm going to run through a bunch of different questions about your experience.  


A:        [26:38] Sweet.


Q:        [26:29] You've already touched on some of these things.  So, if there's anything you feel compelled to talk more about or haven't mentioned, this is a great time.  Do you hold any commercial fishing licenses or have any LPAs in your name?  


A:        [26:51] No.  


Q:        [26:52] Do you have any experience in bookkeeping, bait, or gear preparation,


A:        [26:58] Not bait or gear too much.  I do a lot of the bookkeeping here, but we don't really use – bait doesn't really apply to us too, too much.


Q:        [27:12] Sure.  What about hatcheries, research or development, that kind of stuff?


A:        [27:15] I have dabbled.  It's something that I'm super interested in.  Gil (sp?) my coworker, leads the hatchery setup that we have here.  She’s so smart.  It was really funny.  Last year, we both got injured on the same day.  We took a skiing trip, but it did not work out well for either of us.  But it worked out because we had that time to put together our hatchery more completely.  In that time, I got quite a bit of knowledge on setting up a settlement facility – just a lot of plumbing.  It's a lot of plumbing.  I've been helping her out with that and trying to get as much knowledge as I can.


Q:        [28:02] Cool.  I know you said you distribute a lot to distributors, but any consumer interface, food prep, anything like that?


A:        [28:09] Not too, too much.  I think because of a lot of what we do here, the people who I interact with the most are the other distributors, a lot of other people in the industry, but not as much individual people.  I have, in the past, also worked for restaurants that serve Bangs Island Mussels, so I've been on the other end of it before, but I have not experienced that on this end.


Q:        [28:48] Yeah.  Can you talk a little bit more about – I don’t know – selling seafood and now being on the processing end if you feel like there's any –


A:        [28:55] It's fascinating.  It's a weird, full-circle moment sometimes.  I spent six years at a restaurant.  We served mussels every single day, and I never really paid attention to – I knew that they were good and I liked to eat them, but I didn't really, at the time, acknowledge, “Where are these coming from?”  Other than I know that they're from Casco Bay.  Now that I am back on the complete other end of it, it's interesting.  There's almost a reassurance.  I'm like, “Oh, I know exactly where my food is coming from.”  If I'm plating up this mussel app for somebody, I know now that I can tell you exactly where that mussel came from and whose hands it passed through.  I don’t know.  Sometimes, any prepared food or going out to eat, there's always a part of me that's like, “Oh, where did this come from?”  But now I'm like, “I know,” at least for part of it.  


It's interesting being on this end and knowing what's also expected from customers.  I think a lot of what we do at Bangs is – we focus quite a bit on quality.  Our biggest thing is making sure that we are producing the best mussels that we can.  We really pride ourselves on that.  I think knowing on the other end of – I never really encountered anybody finding a mussel that was bad or anything.  So, just trying to be like – as I'm processing here and inspecting, keeping in mind in the back of my head if I was giving this to a table, would I feel comfortable knowing that there's a crack in this shell or something?  How would I want this presented to me if I were going out to eat?  I think that that dynamic has definitely helped put things into perspective here.


Q:        [31:06] For sure.  What a cool thing to happen.


A:        [31:08] Yeah, it was really weird.  I was like, “Oh, we were doing this the whole time?”  It was fun.


Q:        [31:15] Great.  And do you have any experience in –?  You've mentioned a lot post-harvest processing.  But what about marketing, anything with trade, stuff like that?


A:        [31:24] Not too, too much here.  I'm learning a lot of the trade stuff as I go.  Most of my previous job history was in a lot of customer service or food service.  One of the things coming into here was – I don't know – I'm not super comfortable using a table saw.  A lot of the machines that we have are Italian, and the manuals that we got are mostly in Italian.  So, trying to teach myself how to make major repairs on something where I don't have a lot of previous information – it's definitely been on the job.  But then marketing, I guess, not too, too much.  That's mostly Annie's purview.


Q:        [32:18] Great.  And what about advocacy, extension, or any community-based organization related to aquaculture?


A:        [32:25] I've been dipping my toe into that this year.  I was fortunate enough to do the Women in Aquaculture workshops that Annie and Jax had put together, but just getting into it.  I would love to do more.  I'm super passionate about opening doors for people because this is super cool, but it's also very – it presents as very – you have to be a certain kind of way to get in here.  I think informing people and creating opportunities for people to do something that's really fun and interesting – and it's hard work, but it's also a great way to end the day of like, “Wow, I did this crazy thing today, but I also moved 7000 pounds of mussels.” (laughter) I would like to get more into that.  Yeah.


Q:        [33:30] That might segue nicely into our next question, which is a big one, so feel free to answer it in any way it feels right.  How do you feel like your background or identity shapes your work, including the way that maybe you're perceived or treated?


A:        [33:45] I don't know.  I'm fortunate enough that this particular workplace, the crew that I work with, is very accepting, despite – we all have different views on things.  I think what I really value about my team is that people are still open, and you have a seat at the table to present what you've got going on.  In that way, it's definitely been a privilege to come into a place like this and feel like I can present myself in a way that feels authentic without fear of reprisal.  I think, in the same hand, there's obviously differences in the experience.  


This company has two female and one female-presenting employees, and everybody else is a cis white man.  There’s certain things where it's just a different experience.  Delivery drivers don't call the six-foot-three-280-guy “sweetheart.”  It's different interactions with people.  A lot of the time, it's not threatening, and it's not like I'm really encountering malice with a lot of people.  It's just ignorance, which is also why I'm fortunate that here, people are willing to listen and educate themselves otherwise, but you don't always get that.  


I am, I guess, non-binary – queer.  I'll just go with that.  But I prefer they/them pronouns.  I will respond to “she” because I know how I present.  I know that what I'm doing, where I am, I'm more likely to hear that, even if I do reiterate, that's not really how I feel.  So, I'll take the L, but it's definitely – I don't want to say minor things because it's an identity issue, but at the same time, I can handle those sorts of minor things as opposed to – I have yet to have anybody be hostile.  


I think there's also a degree of – being female-presenting, I therefore live that experience.  Being in a male-dominated industry, there's obviously cis straight male attitudes towards people with women's bodies.  I've definitely encountered people who get a little too comfortable too quick.  It’s hard, I think, especially now that I'm in a management position, being somebody where – I had one employee who was especially difficult, and it's hard for me.  I'm five-four.  I'm living in a woman's body, and I'm trying to tell this very tall, built man, “Hey, you need to do this thing.  I need you to follow what I'm telling you to do,” because a lot of the time, they're like, “I don't care what you have to say.”  I feel like a lot of times where, I don't really get taken seriously.  


This one particular employee was making physical contact right out the gate.  I'm like, “I know you're not putting your hands on your male co-workers.”  I know you only feel comfortable – because I watch you.  I work with you, and I know how you interact with them, and I know that you're not – this treatment is different.  I understand what the discrepancy is, but we need to figure out for you why one person gets to have their boundaries respected, and another one doesn't.  


Again, I'm fortunate enough that situations like that we handle efficiently.  People get spoken to.  We are very good at holding people accountable here.  Can't speak for a lot of the other industry.  I have been privileged in that my experience so far has been fine.  It's been typical of how I walk through the earth anyway.  I do think that there are – interacting with people who work outside of this space, even just my coworkers, as opposed to the delivery guys or clients and stuff – you can tell the women that work with you are probably not having a great time.  


It's challenging, but it's also – I don't know.  I guess it's a constant opportunity for me to feel more comfortable establishing my boundaries and laying them out and not being willing to compromise on them because I'm your boss. (laughter) I don't know.  It's tough, but I also think that aquaculture, as opposed to commercial fishing – I think because aquaculture is newer as an industry, and there's a bit more of like a sustainability focus to it, I think that there's more opportunity for people to be open-minded, as opposed to good old boys commercial fishing.  There's always room for progress.


Q:        [40:29] Yeah.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Sort of a similar shift – it's a related question, but not necessarily.  How do you feel like your work or role interacts with any family or caregiving responsibilities you may have, if you have any?


A:        [40:44] I'm fortunate enough that I don't have anybody that I have to take care of at home.  I think, at least here, that is something that we strive to make sure that the few people that do have families at home, if you need to head out, you can head out.  We make sure that – if somebody's on the water, it's a little different because they got to get back here.  I don't know.  I guess we've only got three people here with kids and everybody else – aging parents?  Something’s going on?  Please feel free to go.  I haven't really noticed too much of an issue with that here.  But also, not an awful lot of us have people that we have to care for.


Q:        [41:47] Sure.  Then transitioning to environmental change, can you describe any changes in the marine environment you've noticed in your time working here?  


A:        [41:56] Yeah.  Sometimes, it’s jarring just how much change you notice in such a short period of time.  I started in spring of 2021, and it's not major changes, but there are things that you notice that are different.  I think one of the things I did recently was keeping – I made a comparison of different residual stats that we've had from products.  We keep track of how much seed we get out of the processing shift, how much byss we get out of it, and then how much trash.  Those things are dependent, for the most part, on water quality.  There's other elements that impact on running through machines.  There's different things that affect it, but for the most part, you can tell kind of where the mussels are at based off of what we're getting for residuals.  


From the last three years of data, there's a lengthening between seasons, if that makes sense.  There's parts of the year, like the springtime, we're still dealing with a lot of that winter byss.  We'll get a lot more in that time, as opposed to the end of the year.  Maybe we'll get more seed because stuff is spawning a bit more often at the end of the summer, and you can see the spawning season has started to get a little bit later in the year as October has gotten warmer – November.  Right now, we're still encountering a lot of the winter byss into June and July and stuff, as opposed to usually, it’ll cut out around like April or May.  It’s incremental shifts where the timeline gets pushed a little bit further out of whack.  It’s just to accommodate – mussels don't set as well if the water is warmer or there's just different things that we try to keep track of.  It's hard as things have been getting a little bit less predictable.  


Then the storm situation always just makes things tough.  I think, this past year, with those two major floods we had in January – I've never seen flooding like that before, and I've lived here my whole life, so it was like, “Oh, this is obviously caused by something.”  It's something that we were able to kind of prepare for here.  But even then, the flooding on the second storm in January came up so high that a lot of our machines got damaged.  We can only take so many precautions.  It was crazy.  It was nuts.  Things like that, where it was the first time we had had any flooding here, and then we had two major floods back-to-back.  Yes, it’s January, but January is not always like this.  So, small time changes, but then also crazy storms have been hard to keep pace with.


Q:        [45:40] Yeah.  How are those impacting your work doing the processing?


A:        [45:44] So, with this major storm earlier this year, the flooding came up so high it came two feet into the processing room that was submerged – the bottom two feet.  At least one of our machines – the motor for it is within those two feet.  That motor had been completely soaked with salt water, and it is an integral part of the system.  We had to very quickly find a solution and an alternative motor.  But in the meantime, until that got delivered – because our machines are from Italy – it became – OK, we'll have to manually shovel these things, as opposed to using something that manually tips them.  That’s a lot more work, and it makes the night longer.  So, those sorts of things – mechanical problems that come from unpredicted weather that's definitely tough.  


Something that we've been dealing with right now is because storm season has gotten so intense, the mussels are making a lot more byss, and it's getting a lot stronger.  It’s getting so strong to the point that our machines are having a hard time working through it.  That adds more time to the shift.  It’s more like, how do I find alternative solutions to mechanical problems that are coming out of things I don't have control over?  I would say that's mostly the bulk of it.  


Oh, no, we have – when it rains a lot in Casco Bay, if we get more than two inches of rain in a single storm, the wastewater treatment plant will stop processing.  So, all of that business gets sent into the bay.  When we have major storms like that, we're likely to be shut down because of high pollutant levels in the water.  And mussels are filter feeders, so that's all up in their business.  As we're getting a lot more – we're not getting snow.  We're getting rainstorms in the winter kind of thing.  A lot more time is spent – OK, we can't harvest today, and it's going to rain again tomorrow, so we might not be able to do it again this week.  Because of that, mussels will grow too big, or they get overset.  It just creates problems down the line.  It’s just been very wet. (laughter) It's hard to accommodate how constantly wet things are, which is odd because it's the ocean, but too wet is not, not good, I guess.  


Q:        [48:39] Yeah.  Is there anything you're doing to try to cope or adapt to that?


A:        [48:44] We've been trying to make adjustments to our seeding times, trying to track spawning events and maybe anticipating – maybe we'll do it a little bit later because if we're closed, that will give – if it sets later, then maybe we won't have to worry about overset in the storm season, trying to keep track of our previous data and just looking for trends and trying to see – have these things been occurring?  What can we do to adjust it?  I think with the – like, with the byss situation, it required – we changed out a bunch of the stuff in the machine so that they're fresh and brand new.  That has helped quite a bit.  But just making sure that all of our stuff is running as smoothly as possible so that, at the very least, we can try and mitigate any hang-ups.  But it's hard to predict.


Q:        [49:54] Do you feel like those things are moving you in the right direction like they're working and helping?


A:        [49:59] I think so.  I think it's also – a lot of what we do we're learning a lot on the fly.  Even just keeping track of these certain things, like, are the teeth and the bars dull?  OK?  Well, that's not going to work through the byss as well as we wanted.  That's helping me not just know what we can do to make sure that we're being more efficient here, but also what we can be doing with the machines to make sure that everything is – it's been a lot of learning. (laughter) It's been a lot of learning of how to make sure that everything is absolutely in tip-top shape so that we can deal with the uncontrollable elements and try and get as much that I can control in a place where I know that I've done the most that I can, but it's quite the learning process.


Q:        [50:55] Yeah, I'm curious with like that learning, what are you drawing on to help you with that, if anything?


A:        [51:03] A lot of it – I am fortunate enough that quite a few of my coworkers have previous experience in the industry or have been here for a while and know how the machines work.  I'm not a particularly machine-minded person myself, and so a lot of it I have been learning through just Googling things, rereading manuals multiple times, and asking as many questions as I can.  I'm fortunate enough that I have quite a few resources here, but there is a lot of it where it's just me, like, “OK, well, let's see how many times I can turn this and see what happens.”  I think if you take things apart, you can usually figure out how to put it back together.  So, go through that and then see what I can do.  


Q:        [51:57] Yeah, and are there any – I don't know – organizations or trainings or things that you could draw on to help as you look towards the future?


A:        [52:06] Not that I'm aware of.  I'm not super familiar.  I think there's also – I think a lot of the workshops that we had done in this Woman in Aquaculture series had been based around different skills that maybe are not as readily available.  I think one of them – we spent an entire day just teaching people how to tie knots and hooking up trailers and stuff like that, and a lot of things that would seem basic – if you're going into this, you should already know how to do that, but I didn't, and a lot of people don't.  It was interesting hearing from a number of other people there that like, “Oh, this is information I'm just finding out for the first time.  Nobody's ever taught me this before.”  


On my end, I'm not aware of too many opportunities other than going to a training, a school of some kind, or some sort of trade activity.  But I think that there's definitely room for more, especially just the rudimentary stuff, like differences between wrenches.  They don't tell you these things.  Yeah.  I would like to go to more.


Q:        [53:35] As you look towards the future, what other things do you really hope to do to think about adaptation or think about learning more?


A:        [53:48] I would love to go back to school just in general.  I think on my end, I'm always looking for more opportunities to learn.  I really enjoy learning.  What I do here, I have a lot of opportunity to figure out how machines work.  On top of that, I can figure out plumbing for the most part.  There's a lot of opportunity where I'm at, which I'm grateful for.  I think a lot of the different – I’m trying to think of the word – different things that we could do.  Hold on a second, sorry.  I'm trying to constantly think of different machinery we can bring into the space to alleviate a lot of the ergonomic difficulties that come with the job.  


That comes down to – I keep track of people on social media.  I'm following a lot of pages.  I'm in a few newsletters.  We had gone to the Seafood Expo in Boston this past year, which was super interesting.  That was a great opportunity to connect with different people who make different shipping packages and different things to make just the job easier.  I think going to as many – any function – as possible.  I think just getting out there as much as you can, no matter what will help to a degree.


Q:        [55:41] Yeah, for sure.  As you look towards the future, what is your biggest concern for the marine environment?


A:        [55:48] A lot. (laughter) We're fortunate in Maine to have a fairly healthy marine ecosystem still.  I can't speak to numbers too much on my end, but I think that there's – a lot of people in Maine really do care about the water.  It's our shared space.  It's our home.  I think one of the biggest things that I'm worried about is the exponential rate that climate change has been getting worse.  One of the things that we do here – we have nets that go around our rafts that keep ducks out, but the nets are made from a polyurethane twine system, and that is used because organic matter has a higher propensity of disintegrating.  


We use a lot of the plastic to make sure that it doesn't fall apart in the water.  But when you're making repairs to that, as you're cutting, that's tiny pieces of plastic that can get anywhere, and we try to be very conscious of that here, but there's obviously things that you can't get.  I remember reading an article a couple months ago about – they've been finding what they thought were – they thought it was a new type of coral, but it ended up being chunks of plastic from netting that had calcified and turned into rocks that animals that eat coral had been trying to eat to get nutrients out of it, but they're just eating plastic.  I remember seeing that and being like, “I am working on one of those nets later today.  That's not great.” (laughter) 


There's so much that goes into it that requires – boats need fuel.  A lot of it is dependent on – we use a lot of gas.  The infrastructure for the industry right now is based around consumables that aren't sustainable.  I think a lot of what we use is plastic because that is what will last the longest in ocean conditions.  But in doing so, we're also putting plastic in the ocean, even if it is secured.  Sometimes, it could undone, and now that will just sink to the bottom.  Not even just plastic.  There's everything else that's in the water.  But that's one of the things that I’m most conscious about because I can see it.  So, stuff like that.  


It’s hard because it seems as though a lot of legislation is trying to be passed to keep better track of where are people putting their things and what are you dumping in the water, just to make sure that people are doing things up to code.  There are a lot of people – that feels like an infringement.  I think that the educational difference is a bigger hurdle to try to get past because you can be worried as much as you want about what's going on, but if people don't want to follow the changes that other people are trying to make so that we can mitigate this, you're not really going to make an awful lot of progress.  It’s one of those things where I'm kept up at night thinking about, “Oh, the world is burning,” but then I’m like, “A lot of people don't think so.”  It’s tough, but again, I guess education is one of the only ways you can get people to think differently.


Q:        [1:00:13] You kind of anticipated my next question, and I’m going to ask it again anyway in case anything new comes up.  If you could tell a policymaker or someone in charge – what is really important, do you think, for them to do or to have in mind to help people adapt to the problems that are happening?  What would you say?


A:        [1:00:30] I think, especially given today's climate, there are quite a few people who have been doing things the traditional way.  That's how my family's been doing it.  This is how we've been doing it for generations.  I feel like a lot of those folk are the hardest to convince that the policy changes that we're making, even though it's extra steps for you during the day, it's for the sake of your grandchildren having a job.  That being said, it's hard to communicate that without people taking that, in and of itself, as an attack.  I'm a big proponent of you have to meet people where they are.  Even if it's somewhere that you really don't want to go, you have to take a step into that mud so you can help pull them back out.  


A lot of that – you have to figure out the language that people are speaking if you want to communicate with them effectively.  I grew up in a fairly rural, poor family with a lot of interesting opinions.  I didn't go to college, and now I'm a farmer, and there's an expectation of a belief system there.  On my end, I can understand the feeling of, “Oh, these college honkies are coming down and trying to tell me what to do when I've been doing it forever.”  But yeah, it's their job.  It's because they went to school to figure this out so that they could help you because we didn't have to – anyway.  


I think that trying to bridge that gap between the more embedded-in-the-industry folk, the more traditionalists, trying to have an understanding between them and the people who actually have the capacity to make the changes – they have to try and find a way to form a middle ground.  If we could figure out that, we could solve a lot of problems, but I think steps can always be made by being empathetic.  I think it's easy to see – people just going about their business as they always have, knowing the impact that it has, and get frustrated because I'm like, well, that's also my space that you're damaging, even though it's none of ours.  It's the ocean.  I would like to use it too and not worry about it being full of things.  


It’s easy to get frustrated, but I think taking a step back and being like, “OK, well, also, a lot of people – this has been their only source of income for their entire life and their parents’ entire lives, and they live in a community that has for the most part been forgotten.”  So, everybody is barely getting by, and when they are getting by, it's on 14-hour days lobster fishing or whatever they're doing.  So, having somebody who probably hasn't done it before, probably lives somewhere else, and having them come in and be like, “You're doing this wrong.  Here's what you need to be doing differently.  It's going to help us all in the end” – yes, you're right.  This is correct, but people may take it as an attack.  Yeah.  I guess just trying to find that empathetic middle ground.


Q:        [1:04:38] Yeah.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Sort of another shift.  Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training?


A:        [1:04:48] I have not.  


Q:        [1:04:52] What do you think –?  And again, you touched on this, but just in case, there's anything else you think might be useful.  What strategies do you think might be effective in building resilience against climate-related impact?


A:        [1:05:04] Broken record.  I always say education, even just open-minded education.  It sounds weird.  I remember my first day that I came in here for an interview.  I walked in, and one of the guys was like, “Oh, nice to meet you.  She'll be down in a minute.  Let me show you around here and tell you what we do,” and just openly being like, “Let me tell you.  I want you to know these things because I think it's cool.  I know you might think it's cool too.”  Taking an approach like, “Hey, we need to take care of our house a little bit better,” I think, is always a decent means of making some sort of progress.  


Getting back to the exponential rate at which climate change has been making things more difficult, at some point – I mean, we're well past where you could try and deny it, I would argue.  But if you're still feeling like, “Oh, well, it's nice out today” – OK.  But have you noticed that maybe your product has been getting a little bit smaller.  Are we seeing – trying to relate – have you seen differences in your yields in what you're producing?  Are you making less money?  Let’s figure out what the source of that is.  Is it structural issues with the industry and commercialism?  Probably, maybe.  


But are there also factors of it that are directly related to the fact that the water is hotter and more acidic, and there's different elements that are different and are categorically different from five years ago, let alone 30?  Trying to present people with facts in a way that's not like I'm info dumping on you and just giving you a bunch of information, but trying to relate those facts back to you, like, “This is how this impacts you, and your family and what you and your community are up to,” also, in a way that's not like I'm attacking you, but as a “we should care about each other because we're all that we have.”  


So, I guess, yeah, I'm just a big advocate for sharing information as much as you can and making sure that it's fact-checked/available.  Those sorts of things, and then also just reiterating to the people that do have the power to make decisions – we're at the point where we have to make – we're past irreparable damage.  We have to make extreme changes if we have any chance of survival, which is drastic, but that's where we're at.  At the same time, reiterating to the people that do have the power to make those decisions – we can't make a huge change all at once.  You have to meet people where they are and figure out what they can accommodate because while it is us on the bottom, it's not entirely us on the bottom.  Let's see what we can do without making life more difficult for the people that already have a hard time.  


Matt, the owner here, he's in a lot of – he goes to the town council meetings.  He goes to a lot of the – just meeting with people that have the ability to make change and trying to really reiterate, “This is what we're needing.  This is what we're needing that will directly benefit us, and here's what's realistic.”  So, just getting involved, I think.


Q:        [1:09:17] Yeah.  Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes you've seen?


A:        [1:09:24] I definitely think a lot of what we've been doing here – it's incremental.  We installed a water recycling system in the processing room so that we're able to – actually, it cut our water use by 50%, which is really cool.  But instead of having two separate water sources, taking the runoff from one, and in the recycling unit, it pulls out stuff – the organic matter – and then sends it into another system, and that water is using that water source.  So, trying to limit what excess waste we're doing on our ends, making sure that, if we are using water, we keep it to the minimum of where it needs to be, and making sure the lights are turned off at the end of the day.  I definitely think that small mechanical changes that we can try and get to limit our impact – I think those are helpful.  


A lot of our focus here is sustainability so that we have a job in the future.  That's why we do a lot of our reseeding efforts, so that stuff isn't just going back out to sea.  Even then, we have specific sites in the bay where we dump our trash, and a lot of the trash – if a mussel has a hairline fracture, it's still alive and can heal that.  So the places that we dump, we stagger it, so it's not some major thing, but that ends up becoming a mussel bed.  We've seen, over the course of time, that that becomes its own little ecosystem because where the mussels are, some of them are dead, and that's food.  So, providing opportunities for the little critters that do the bulk of the work to have a place to stay.  It sounds like, “Oh, we're dumping our trash into the sea,” but it has a purpose there.  We do a lot of stuff like that with the focus of we can do what we can here so that, hopefully, things will be better for the next farmer.  Little stuff.


Q:        [1:11:58] Yeah.  Looking towards the future, what is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [1:12:05] I would like to see a bit more focus on the industry as a whole.  I realize that Maine is known for its fish and stuff.  But I think aquaculture is having a moment because it's newer.  It’s newer, and there's a lot more acceptance of changes.  I think, in that way, it's easy for this industry to get the funding that it needs and the connections that it needs, whereas I think there's a lot of multi-generation lobster fishermen up the coast in towns that haven't really – that's been the industry.  There's a lot of consistency there, but there's not enough – I think it comes back to empathy on a legislative level.  I think that a lot of the frustration, to a degree is – I think a lot of people feel like they've been forgotten.  


Then, on top of that, there's a lot of the – “Oh, well, the problems with Maine lobstering,” which is its own box of frogs.  I think that it's easy to get stuck in the negative spiral, especially when you're already like, “I'm poor.  I am a lobster fisherman.  I've been living here my whole life.  My parents were living here their whole life.”  It's easy to get into that spiral, not even just on the coast, but that's something that happens a lot with Mainers in general.  A lot of sparseness in the communities makes it tough.  I would love to see the same level of focus that aquaculture has been getting dedicated towards a lot of the other industries along the coast, and even just – I think kelp has been coming up quite a bit recently, and that's something that's a bit more accessible.  


So, lobster fishermen haven't – if there's a season for them, they can fit kelping in, and that, in and of itself, growing kelp has a lot of positive impacts.  So, opening up doors for people to have access to alternative revenue streams that at the same time have a long-term benefit to them.  Trying to find the balance of making sure that people have money to live while also caring about the place where they live.  It's tough.  It's tough.


Q:        [1:15:15] Yeah.  Do you feel like you've noticed – This is different – but do you feel like you've noticed any difference in women’s and non-men's participation and presence in fisheries and aquaculture in your time working in it?  


A:        [1:15:28] It's hard for me to say just because this has been my introduction to the industry for the most part, outside of recreation in the past.  My dad was a commercial fisherman in Alaska for a while.  I had heard so much of – “This is a man's field” kind of thing.  I grew up anticipating, “Oh, I don't know if that will be an opportunity that I'll have.”  But then I started here, and the first manager that I had was Gil, and she's now running the RSF. (sp?)  So, little things like that, where I'm like, “OK, there are plenty of other people around.  You just have to find them and hope that they're cool.” (laughter) 


Even in my hiring for the land team, I've noticed an increase in women and female-presenting folk coming through, as opposed to – I was getting a lot of mid-forties cis white men for a while.  And, A, they don't really want to listen to me, but B, that's cool.  I'll take you.  But I also would like to have a seat available for maybe somebody who doesn't have as much opportunity.  A lot more of the women-plus folk that I've seen coming through are also coming from an educational background, as opposed to – I'm getting a lot of men who aren't.  I'm curious about that difference of the trade aspect of it as opposed to the scientific aspect of it.  But it’s cool to see either way.  


Q:        [1:17:43] Yeah, great.  Thank you so much.  Is there anything else you wanted to share before we end the interview?  


A:        [1:17:48] I don’t think so.  I really do enjoy what I do.  I, again, cannot emphasize how much of a privilege it is to work at a place where my identity is respected, and I feel as though there are some things we don't agree on, but the team that I work with – we care about each other.  I think that that's hard to find, but I think especially in the industry where you spend so much time together under dangerous circumstances, a lot of the time, there's almost a trauma bond.  I think that that is a resource that really would benefit people having – just feeling like you're supported by your team.  We've all worked together for so long that we're like a family.  It is nice to know that if anything happens, we all feel like we've got each other's back, and trying to find a way to perpetuate that onto other people would be nice because it's lovely and it makes work a lot easier.  I think that also just comes down to being open and being able to hold two things at once.  We will get there as we get there.  I think that's about the bulk of it.  Yeah, that's all I got.  But thank you so much.  


Q:        [1:19:37] Great.  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  I will turn this off.  


END OF FILE"
"8","Q:        [0:00] OK.  We’ll start with your name and how you like to introduce yourself.


A:        [0:06] My name’s Anna Drzewiecki, and I say they, she or no pronouns at all.  And I live in Newcastle.


Q:        [0:15] OK.  Awesome.  And what year were you born?


A:        [0:19] I was born 2000.


Q:        [0:20] OK.  And tell me about where you grew up.


A:        [0:25] I grew up on Peaks Island in Casco Bay and I lived there until I was like 10 or 11.  And at that point, my family moved to Portland.


Q:        [0:39] And where are your parents from?  What do they do?


A:        [0:42] My mom is not from Maine.  She’s from like Maryland area, and she has become white-collar, (inaudible) thing kind of career.  


        While we out in Peaks, like a lot of folks work in all sorts of different ways, on/off the water, although a lot less so now rather than historically.  So my parents both had like office jobs while I worked – while we lived on Peaks.  


        And my dad and my step-mom are both from Maine.  My dad is from central Maine actually, and he is now a business owner in Portland.  He’s a map maker by training.  So now he sells mapping software.  And my stepmother’s from Woolwich.  Yeah.  And she works in healthcare.  And they live in Portland.


Q:        [1:36] Got you.  So does anyone in your family have a history in fishery?


A:        [1:40] In my stepmother’s family, they’re all from Wiscasset, Dresden, Woolwich, that area.  And a lot of cousins who I don’t know very well.  I mean they all like clam digging, worms, some lobstering.  But I don’t know them well, so it’s not been a part of my history.


        And my brother and I – besides that, my brother and I are the only ones who really worked on the water.  And to my knowledge, although my brother’s done a lot of things I don’t know about, to my knowledge, he has only worked on sea farms, oyster farming from a pretty young age, and also chucking and like in the restaurants type of things.


Q:        [2:28] Got you.  Do you have any other siblings?


A:        [2:33] No, just one brother.


Q:        [2:34] OK.  And how did you guys get into that world?  Was it just where you were or interest?


A:        [2:40] Definitely a combination of both.  At the time on Peaks Island – so my brother started working for our friend’s farm, Basket Island Oysters at the time, which I think is Peaks Island shell fish now.  And Mark Green is one of the cofounders.  And he was a good family friend.  And he was the only one at the time On Peak’s doing this kind of thing.  And it was very experimental and like climate and ecology driven in the sense that he’s a marine biologist and got into oyster farming like his study and research on the bay.


        So my brother started working for him when he was like a young teenager, and that was my first kind of exposure to aquaculture and working on the water.  At that time, I would clean bags occasionally, just very gritty job.  But I didn’t end up working in aquaculture at all until summers in college.  And I found a job at Dodge Cove Marine Farm.


        And I have learned like I really wanted to be on the water.  I didn’t want to be in commercial fishing.  I didn’t want to lobster.  And I’ve – I had some experience in agriculture, but I was really passionate about being back out on the water, and about sea farming like theoretically, but I didn’t have any hands-on experience until – I guess it was like my second summer in college.  And that was really, really interesting when I got started just how things synthesized and how my own passion kind of grew.  But also how I felt, at that time, even though I hadn’t been working in that capacity while I was living on Peaks Island like a sense of reconnection to Maine, a sense of reconnection to place, and the viability of a life that would live that way.


Q:        [4:45] Thank you.  Can you describe your educational background.


A:        [4:53] Yeah.  We went to public school through high school, and then I moved to California for my first year of college, and I finished college during the pandemic in York at Sarah Lyons College.  And I am actually still in a graduate program in visual material at Museum Anthropology in the UK.  So I’m just finishing my dissertation back in Maine.


Q:        [5:22] Wow.  (inaudible).  Welcome back (inaudible).


A:        [5:26] Thanks.  


Q:        [5:28] Are you married?


A:        [5:30] No, I’m not married.


Q:        [5:31] Do you have any children?


A:        [5:33] Just a dog.


F:        [5:36] Can I just interrupt to ask you to describe your current work role?


A:        [5:40] Yeah.  Do you mean my current employment or my current academic work?


F:        [5:47] The academic work but also maybe the employment if it feels relevant.


A:        [5:51] Yeah.  Well, it does feel relevant because before I went to grad school – so I graduated from college and I worked for two summers at that point in aquaculture, and I moved back to Maine from New York for personal reasons.  I started working at a newspaper, a local newspaper, which actually gave me like a deep sense of place here, and actually, that why I learned a lot more about Nina’s (sp?) full governing and got really interested in local politics, around the coast and climate, but just in general.  And I took a job – I started oyster farming again at that point.


        So I was working for a little over a year full time, both on and off the water for an oyster farm, like a medium-size farm on the Damariscotta River for – yeah, a little over a year before I went to graduate school.  


        So I could have continued in that way.  I decided I really want to continue my momentum on my academic work, so that’s why I kind of decided to break at that point and go.  So currently, my academic work is in anthropologies of food and multisensory and multispecies anthropology.  And I’m doing a close, clear multi-species study with oysters.


        So the way that I learned from oysters is less of a top-down analytical approach and more of like a close and bottom-up multitrophic approach.  And the way that I’m using that (inaudible) kind of access and think through questions around the coast, around aquaculture, in particular around industrialization through oysters as a lens, or with the organism as a kind of lens in the first (inaudible).


Q:        [7:49] Wow.


A:        [7:50] Yes.  That’s what I’m working on right now.  A lot of oyster eating and observational – observations on taste and display methods and materiality.  So.


Q:        [8:04] That’s exciting.  We’ll definitely follow your work with that.


A:        [8:07] Yeah.  (laughter).


Q:        [8:10] How would you describe your role in the fishing and aquaculture industry in Maine.


A:        [8:15] I was thinking a lot about this.  Because it’s kind of fraught in the sense that I consider myself a sea farmer, although right now I’m in this kind of dual capacity as a researcher.  And I’m also not on the water this summer.  And the reason I’m not is because I felt very committed to like an ethical separation between working in the commercial world while I was doing this research, and the research that I’m doing.  And so, well, that’s very important to me as potential conflict of interest.


        I’m also in this position now where I’m not on the water every day, even though that’s become such an essential part of my identity, especially being back in Maine.


        So I would say that right now I’m in – like my relationship is transitional and adapting, but it’s definitely where I situate myself.  Whether it’s my creative works, so like writing and photography, whether it’s research in an academic sense.  Even freelance journalism too, or my day to day.  And I am aspirational towards having my own operation.  But what I envision is something that’s very nontraditional.  


        And I’m not a landowner, and I don’t have a boat.  And I don’t have a truck.  And I don’t have any commercial licenses, so I don’t currently harvest anything unless I am working as an employee for someone.


        So, yeah, my relationship, I would say, is like the center point of how I orient my work now and my future work.  And by work I just mean like the way I live.  But it’s also, definitely – there’s definitely tension around it too.


Q:        [10:18] That makes sense.  What would you say hooked you in doing this kind of work?


A:        [10:28] Just the embodied experience of it.  I think as much as I could have read about regenerative ocean farming, as much as I had a preconceived notion of aesthetics and the lifestyle of fishing and working on the water, really, ultimately, it was the embodied experience and the sensory experience of doing that type of work.  And relating to ecology in that way that ultimately hooked me.  It sunk its teeth into me.  Yeah.


Q:        [11:12] You mentioned potentially having a non-traditional farm – 


A:        [11:16] Yeah.


Q:        [11:17] – based on (inaudible; overlapping dialogue) was like, if you will.


A:        [11:20] Yes, I can.  So it’s always changing.  My ideas are always changing.  But in essence, what I would strive for, or what I’m really interested in is different – integrating different species, and not just focusing on one species.  


        I’m really interested in plastic-free and reduced plastic use, which is incredibly challenging, actually, when it comes down to getting started.  If I had disposable income from the inter-generational wealth, a very different story, which I don’t mean that to like – it’s not a job anybody who’s doing that now, it’s just a reality of the type of resources that it takes and the time to start in a more experimental mode.  But that’s what I’m interested in.


        So right now, what I’m trying to figure out is a creative way to get started and get a foothold, I’d say.  And what I envision as a multi-sided, hopefully algae in oysters because that’s where my passion and experience is.  Farm sites/studios/political education/cultural education space as I imagine.


        I’m also really interested in wild (inaudible) collection.  And I say that because it’s a good entry also into the other kind of motivating factor behind this vision, besides encompassing my interests and creating a space with conditions for flourishing for myself and for organisms and for other people.  


        It’s also something that I see as like an interruption or intervention, especially on the Damariscotta River in patterns of industrialization and what’s becoming like a – actually, a likely more entrenched kind of patriarchy on the river, whereas that actually wasn’t historically the case here.  


        And throughout this process, I’m especially interested in how can we – like how can my process of going through – a lease application going through now – the LPA application going through all of these logistics and bureaucratic processes, plus the embodied work of it all in labor, how can I document and move through that in a way that’s also collaborate and – for example, when it comes to indigenous rights and Wabanaki sovereignty, there’s no way – I don’t – I’m not aware of anybody who’s thinking in a decolonial mode who’s running a farm right now.  


        So I’m really interested in how can I go through this process and work with folks to address how we might handle that in a different way, how we might create or provide – well, not create or provide access, but enable and honor access and –  Yeah, I mean, (inaudible).  You know?  


        I can – just you talking about it, but in essence, I think the idea is creating an experimental, multi-sided – multi-sided and multi-purpose and collaborative non-traditional economic model.  A farm site that’s also kind of a direct action intervention space that is growing really high-quality organisms in a really ethical way, but also thinking with all of these political and cultural questions.


Q:        [15:13] Right.  Oh, thank you.


A:        [15:14] Yeah.


Q:        [15:17] You’re thinking at night, you’re not just (inaudible).  (laughter)


A:        [15:19] Oh, I’m thinking all the time.  (laughter)


Q:        [15:22] Yeah.  You have any experience in the industry beyond directly harvesting itself and give some examples, like bookkeeping, bait or gear preparation, post-harvesting, processing, marketing, trade and advocacy community-based organizations related fishery (inaudible)?  (inaudible).  


A:        [15:46] No, I mean, all this – a few things that come to mind, but then maybe doing it again, I’ll see if I missed anything, because I will say, not just for myself, it’s very common to – I think especially for young folks, like piecing together seasonal work and piecing together, I mean, a lot of folks who maybe have food experience.  Like a lot of restaurant work.


        So I’ve done a lot of work in restaurants in addition to this.  And actually, a number of people come to mind who are working full time in sea farming or fishing, and to our – like working as bartenders in restaurants on weekends.  


        For me, that would look like working front of house in emerging places, but the most directly related would be like farm store equity points.  So that’s really working with people with oysters in kind of a hard space.  Yeah.  


        But actually, the other thing is that while I was at the farm that I was most recently at, which is Boxum (sp?) Fine Oysters, I was working on and off the water, so I wrote a handbook.  I was working on sustainability certifications, social media, marketing, etc.  Sometimes while you’re on the water too, that’s like lunchtime work, or we call it after-work work 


        So, yeah, definitely a lot of that type of bookkeeping, marketing kind of stuff, but that would be coinciding with while I was also physically working as a farmhand.


Q:        [17:29] (inaudible).  And going jumping back to your research, are you ever in the field or is it mainly – what would that look like to you?


A:        [17:39] Yeah, I mean, it has looked like being in the field at raw bars, shadowing like oyster farm tours.  And then, I’ll probably get back out onto the farm like next week or something, and it also looks like trying to navigate a lot of really complicated relationships around aquaculture narratives and aquaculture trajectories in Maine, because it is so polarized and because as a researcher, I have a more – my interest as a researcher don’t always align with the interests of researchers at – working on – I mean, not you mean as a whole, but industry-related research is not where my focus is.  


        So at the moment, I’m trying not to create a tower for myself – like an artificial tower for myself, but I’m also trying to be very careful about like the ways that I’m engaging with the commercial side, especially, and then also actually with research going on at like UMaine, for example, that’s a sea grant from the university.  


        So that’s just because I have this – I’m trying to do my best to honor and make the most of the perspective that I have from the university, and I am somewhat critical of some of the blurriness between industry and academia in my research.  So it’s put me in that kind of position where I am in the field sometimes, but I’m also trying to be very careful about that, and it’s a very short window of research so I have the opportunity to do that.


F:        [19:34] Yeah, (inaudible; overlapping dialogue) decide.  I don’t know.  I was really struck with the way you described conceptionally the work you’re doing right now with your dissertation, and I’m curious if you could describe, I don’t know, the places, like the methodological places that comes from, or like what you’re drawing from, because I’m very interested in your point of view with it, and the way you’re approaching it which is really different, I think.


A:        [20:01] I think – so, in terms of anthropology, it comes from visual anthropologies and practices in – that have been developed in material anthropology, things like object biographies, multispecies ethnographies.  And in particular, work on craft and skill.  


        Yeah.  So that’s kind of coming from that perspective, and also blending anthropologies of art.  So different forms of performance ethnography and more experimental ethnography practices, like sketching or walking, etc.  But used – like activated in this other way.  Like for me, I’m swimming instead of walking, but I’m drawing on a lot of ethnographies of walking.  


        Or with an object biography – part of what I’m working towards is if I’m tracing the kind of “commographication (sp?) process” of this organism to food object or food commodity, how can I do a different kind of object biography, kind of tracing material processes that allow this organism to become a commodity, but doing so in a way that rejects or resists or plays with some of those conventional ideas that are in supply chains and objecthood for foods.


        But theoretically, it’s coming from a lot of places.  The one that I like to, I guess, highlight is blending my experience as a grower, and that being a very complex experience, and also being a very sensory experience with this position as a researcher.  


        So I’m really interested in the relationship between those forms of knowledge, so the type of knowledge that comes from being a grower or a harvester, and that particular form of embodied knowledge, and seasonal knowledge, and understanding of a perception of time, perception of care, etc., as a grower-harvester, and then how that – intersects with, can contradict some times, and also synchronizes with like the research and theoretical perspectives.  


        So, did I answer your question.  OK.  (laughter)


Q:        [22:26] Yeah.  You kind of already touched upon this, but what is an average day of work look like for you?


A:        [22:35] Can I answer in two ways?


Q:        [22:38] Of course.


A:        [22:40] OK.  While I’m doing my research, an average day of work is mostly by myself reading, and I might communicate with lots of people, and I might drive to a nearby restaurant or raw bar, or meet up with farmers after work, so like that’s two or 3 PM.  


        But my partner also works in sea farming, so he’s up at 4:15-ish.  So I’m not up that early, but I do try to maintain that schedule, in part, as part of my research, and part because that’s like (inaudible) my day to day.


        So I’m up early doing a lot of reading and writing and trying to incorporate – I pay attention to the rhythm of aquaculture as it exists here.  Several famous medical – oyster mariculture – well, also just trying to write my dissertation.


        But while I was on the sea farm, when I was out on the water, your day to day always look different, but the rough scaffolding is a 6 AM meeting at Schooner’s which is the marina in town, which is where the farm I worked at would go out for the day, and then heading out to the raft, so our raft was just off of Pod Island, and we would spend most of the day, if not all the day, on the lease either on the raft or in boats with a mix of top culture, bottom culture, and intertidal gear.  


        And then, of course, there’s errands, there’s unexpected events, there’s weather (laughter), there’s emergencies, there’s bathroom trips, all sorts of things.  


        But with that type of work, I would be on the water from 6 to 2 or 7 to 3.  And then, while I was also doing this more of the office work, I would come off the water and do that for an hour or two, sometimes longer.  So that was really exhausting kind of pace, and really – not very sustainable, but unfortunately super common, actually – especially for women, or at least in my experience, just because things like the type of labor that goes in – like the type of creative and intellectual labor that goes into marketing, for example, or social media, is very easy in this industry, in particular, I think, to underestimate, or to erase, or to say, oh, it’s just – it’s easy, you’ll just make a post.  


        And that’s just an example, but in reality, obviously that’s its own kind of animal and its own kind of labor.  And I know a number of young women or gender queer people who also do that type of labor.  And have gone to similar experiences.  Yeah.


Q:        [25:42] How do you feel your background, your identity shaped your work in the fishing sector, including how others perceive or treat you?


A:        [25:52] It’s huge.  I – it’s completely shapes my experience.  I feel like a bit of a shape-shifter,, in terms of my background and identity, and also in terms of the work that I’m doing, as I’ve described, like moving between being a researcher, and a writer, and then being an employee, and then also representing the farms.  So going from being both simply a farm crew member to being the farm’s representative.  And then also working outside of aquaculture.  So I often feel like I’m shape-shifting in that capacity.  


        But then in terms of my identity, for example, my relationships with folks who I’ve met while I was working on the water, is completely shaped by, I think, how I was perceived and how I felt pretty much daily working with – working with men only for a lot of the time, actually, that I was on the water, that I needed to constantly prove myself, constantly mitigate my behavior, like alter my behavior.  Of course, being more concerned about what I’m wearing, how I’m talking, whether I’m perceived as capable, wanting to be seen as confident but also not being overbearing.  All of those classic kind of experiences.


        But those were really heightened for me, especially because I didn’t have experience like driving boats.  So that was new for me, although at the same time I've been on – in and around the water my whole life.  


        And so when it comes to my background, even the fact that I don't know how to drive a boat, there was all this baggage around that for me because I grew up on an island.  It's very weird to for me to not know how to drive a boat and part of that is from my experience in my childhood where we didn't have a boat.  The part that is also gendered in the sense that like a lot of boys and men who grow up my age, whose families didn't have boats, know how to drive boats.  They know how to drive all different sorts of machinery and that's because those opportunities were presented to them.
                                                                                
        And yeah, and I also meet men and was working with men who have been driving boats since they were like two.  So obviously things are weighted in a different direction.  And I think that's just a good – the boat is such a good kind of example of how weighted those experiences are, because it's like if I make a mistake, which I do and I did, if I make a mistake, my credibility was questionable or my capacities were questioned or my like leadership skills would be in question, is how it felt.  Whereas when other people made mistakes, like we'd laugh about it.  And those stories are, they become stories on the river.


        Yeah, I mean, I could keep talking about it.  I got off on a bit of a tangent about the boat.  But one other thing I'll say about the boats is that often we're coming in and out of the public landing, and so whether or not I am being perceived differently because of the way I present or because of my gender, and my age actually, coming in and out of the landing in Damariscotta, I don't know if you saw it, but the launch is – so there's the public parking lot and there's the public landing. And then there's the restaurant and then there's apartment buildings and other restaurants.


        So essentially you're in this like fish bowl and there's a sense of being completely on display.  And not only that, but other farmers are coming in and out from that location like throughout the day.


        So when you're docking the boat, for example, you have the sense that there's eyes on you in all directions.  And honestly sometimes at the end of the day you get a text from somebody who had no idea they were watching you and they make a comment about how you dock the boat.  


        But that sense of being constantly scrutinized really shaped my experience.  And it's something that I'm really wary of kind of going back into work on the water.  And it's something that I like.  


        It's so – it's so malleable like it changes so much depending on the current makeup of the community.  But there are these like just deeply seated ideas for me in terms of how I was perceived and how I was treated based on my gender and also being queer presenting.  


        But that's also a shape-shifting thing where I'm not always queer presenting and so that also shaped my experience.  Those realities are still just as present even if there's – even if there's a majority women and gender queer people on a raft, chances are the person who owns a business is still a middle-aged white man.  That's statistically true on the river and chances are the managers are too.                                                                                                                So yeah, it is adaptable.  It does change.  But that was such a massive part of my experience coming into this field that it's taking a lot of unlearning, and I think it'll take a long time to not have that sense of someone looking over my shoulder.  To not be thinking about like simple, logistical things like where to go to the bathroom, and to not be wary of being sexualized all the time, which honestly wasn't a huge part of my experience, but it is there.  


        And so – and the threat of it just in the world, of course, is there.  So like the threat and the feeling of – the combination of being scrutinized and being in a position where our bodies are kind of constantly on display and having enough encounters that are threatening enough that that's always there, even if the folks I was working with for example, even if that wasn't a problem with the people that I was directly working with.


        I'll let you ask another question before I just keep rambling.


Q:        [32:48] Thank you for sharing.  How does your role in the fishing sector work with your family or caregiving responsibilities?


A:        [32:59] Well, now it's more balanced because, like I said, my partner works in on an oyster farm.  He's a manager and he's usually working – now it's a little bit better but usually working nine to 10 hour days.  Like last summer 50 hour weeks.


        And I mention that because when I'm not working on the water. and it's just one of us, it's easier to balance.  And I don't have caregiving responsibilities for him, but just the shared caregiving of like living a life together is really challenging because being overworked essentially and exhausted all the time.  


        And combination of that – and also I have long term illness.  And so when I was working on the water it was really challenging to balance my own needs and – my own caregiving needs for myself.  It's hard now.  It's a little bit better, but that's an interesting one because I actually think that the work itself is quite accommodating in terms of disability and abilities.


        I think that working on the water in many different capacities can actually be a really accommodating space and a really adaptable space.  But the reality of working for, not necessarily corporate, but corporatizing businesses is different.  It's constantly confronting – yeah, a contradiction between what one needs to do to care for oneself and like efficiency and productivity and business. 


Q:        [34:57] And things are always changing.


A:        [34:59] Yeah and I will say also I don't have any children at home and that's not something that I'm – that's currently a huge concern for me, but it's something that I talk to my peers and friends about.  And it's just interesting as a topic that comes up quite a bit in terms of trying to figure out like whether people want to do that, want to have children, and also how, and also these weirdly kind of valorized stories of like women who were pregnant and kept working while they're pregnant and to what point they were still pregnant and still harvesting, or still pregnant and still sorting.


        And that's their choice of course, but it's just interesting as like a narrative that occurs that valorizes – always valorizing more work at all costs. and treating those women as especially strong and capable, whereas honestly I don't know if anyone has good family leave, or if it's feasible for people to not be working at that phase.


        The person that I'm thinking of who the story revolves around may disagree, but for me it's something that has echoed while I think about that for my own future, and it's something that I notice when I'm talking to my friends and peers.


Q:        [36:29] Very interesting.  (inaudible).  I’m going to switch a little bit to questions of the open-ban (sp?) environmental changes.  Can you describe any changes in the marine environment you've noticed.


A:        [36:42] Definitely.  The first thing that comes to mind is blue crabs because it's the most obvious one and they're so iconic.  In my time on the river we now see blue crabs, which is a very short amount of time.  That's over the course of three-and-a-half years.  And it's not that they weren't there in the past, but not at all in the way that they are now.                                                                                                                                                        
And I say that as if it's an exception, but honestly there have been a lot of changes. And then there's the kind of – I think there's a tendency to focus on specific species.  So for example, ones that concern if you're working for a commercial farm like ones that concern the farm's productivity or efficiency like green crabs and oyster drills, which green crabs have been an issue for folks for a long time.  But they’re always – the sense is that they're kind of always getting worse especially as water has gotten warmer.                                                                                                                                                                        
        Oyster drills similarly, it's not necessarily that we see or noticed more, it's also about the range and new locations where they might be appearing.  At the same time tunicate sets which we would call biofouling.


        I don't have first-hand experience of this changing, but it's something that we're always talking about.  So for example running into someone who's been on the river for decades, we might say, hey, we've noticed a set that seems a lot later than last year.  What do you think?  And more often than not people would say yeah this is the latest that it’s ever set, we've never seen this before.  Or they shared their experience of how it's been in the past.         


        Water temperatures.  The water's warmer, and that means that algae is blooming and crashing at different rates.  And I mean – I guess that I was going to say is there's a tendency to focus on a specific species or a specific element like water temperature, or acidification, or green crabs.  But in reality it's also just the holistic changes and the holistic kind of morphing of what was once a river or an estuary – sorry a river.  What was once an estuary that operated and lived in a certain way, breathed in a certain way and now doesn't or not does so, you know, differently.


        I think in particular of fishing.  So like lobstering doesn't really happen the way that it used to on the Damariscotta.  I'm not super-knowledgeable about its history here, but every year it's kind of pushing further and further back.  And that's not – people have different opinions about that, but my understanding is it's because there are no longer lobster that come up the Damariscotta the way they used to.  


        And then you could look at all sorts of different fish species.        Yeah, like stripers and sturgeon, and then there's alewife run.  And then you could talk about eel grass.  


        So it's kind of all of these different layers, but at least from my perspective and my – the way that I think about it, it is like holistically – it's the holistic change that's really fascinating to have observed in only three years.  


        And then it's even more jarring for me when I go back to Casco Bay and to Peaks Island where I actually kind of usefully have this gap in time.         And I'm there thinking like where are the muscles?  Where are the crabs I used to find as a kid?  Where is the eel grass because there's virtually no eel grass left.  That's not statistically accurate but you know what I mean.


        Yeah and so that also like those early experiences of what the bay or what the coast in Maine is like from my childhood.  Also inform my understanding of like what the norm should be in a place like this.        


        And so that's been interesting for me because it definitely tunes my eye differently.  Like I remember a time where even in the mid-coast where we'd find Jonah crabs or rock crabs and fewer green crabs, or we were still kind of talking about green crabs as a new entity.  And that's just no longer the case.  


        And it's very rare to see a rock crab here for example, and oftentimes, I would say I would find one, and no it's a rock crab, and people haven't seen one before.  So that was something that they maybe didn't even know what to – like how to recognize those species that I was so familiar with from my childhood in Maine.


        Oh.  And I just wanted to mention the anomalies like the shark being in the river two summers ago and a whale.         I'm just mentioning that because like there's also this sense of unease I think like – even for folks who feel like they know this estuary with their eyes closed and they could tell you where they are from being underwater, these kinds of anomalies are really throwing that sense of knowing and that sense of place, just throwing it off and disrupting that.  And creating a sense of unpredictability and dis-ease, and by that I guess I mean unease.  Maybe there's been a shark in the river in the past, but that was a really strange occurrence and it's also likely not actually a strange occurrence or it won't be in the future.


Q:        [42:56] Wow.  The whale too. 


A:        [43:00] I know. 


Q:         [43:01] How – 


A:        [43:02] That was on – 


Q:        [43:03] – how they get whale out?


A:        [43:04] I think it was a baby and it just kind of wandered.  And then I got so – when the whale appeared, like working up from down the river, Ryan, who was the farm manager I was working with, and I kept getting text messages from different people.  So the people who’s furthest down the river would send us a picture, and like, the whale’s here.  And then we get one from the next person who's further up the river until it got up to us.  But I don't know actually what happened with that.


Q:        [43:32] Wow.  How do all those changes impact your work in the sector?


A:        [43:37] I think the thing that – well because I'm not a commercial harvester of something like soft shell clams where that would completely reorient my lifestyle and completely reorient my relationship probably to the coast, it kind of like jump starts or adds momentum in some ways to my trajectory just because the way that I enter this work is through regenerative cultivation or through mariculture.  So it definitely adds like a political and social kind of motivation to the work.  But it also just affects developing a relationship and a sensibility around and with a place.         


        It's a lot less stable when these types of changes are happening at this rate, and in many ways it's like, that's the way that I know how to relate to the sea and to the coast in general is with that sense of unpredictability, or also with the sense of – I don't want to say decline because it's not, but like that type of dynamic.  And that type of that type of dynamic I just mean like that rate and unpredictability of change, and then also just the reality of acidification for example.


        That's like all that I know – and so in my lifetime.  And so it definitely adds an element of – I don't like a lot of the language around resilience actually, but it adds an element of constant adaptability, or an acceptance of the need for like constant adaptability.


        And I would say it also probably aligns me with a lot of the kind of community development and coastal development work, and a lot of the attention around sea farming comes from this perspective, or comes from like the climate savior kind of narrative, which is just interesting to observe as it plays out.  Whereas the same is not true for our for lobstering or for other fisheries where they're often placed on the other end of that debate – if it's a spectrum, they're kind of placed on the other end of the spectrum.        


Q:        [46:30] Is there anything you've done – you try in response to cope with or adapt to the changes?


A:        [46:45] Well, thinking of the farm in particular, I know I didn't talk about winters and ice, but that's a huge – huge change.  


        So for example planning to harvest later into the year and planning to store equipment in different ways because the ice is changing.  That's something that is kind of different every year and definitely impacts how I think about this coming year, because I'll probably be back on the water in the fall, and there's a lot of attention towards creating like year-round work in – in aquaculture.  And in an interesting way it's almost like being facilitated by the fact that winters are lighter than they used to be and ice is different than it used to be, so there's the possibility to harvest later into the year.  


        But that's also causing some tension, and it's not as simple as there's no ice and therefore we can go out and harvest, because like the – it hasn't changed the whole seasonality of farming practices.  I wonder if it will in the future, and definitely for the largest farms like Mook Sea Farm or Miss Gunga's Bay/Dodge Cove.  They use a lot of indoor facilities which mean that they are harvesting year round and they are selling year round regardless of conditions or climate conditions.        


        But also just thinking about heat because I didn't talk about heat. I don't know what there is to say necessarily about adapting, but it just seems to be worse and worse every year.  And as far as like creating an environment that's safe for people to be in – I mean, when you're on a raft you're standing in direct sun for eight or nine hours on and off of the boat with water reflection of course. 


        So people have different like personal strategies for it, but it was something that was really challenging for me last summer more so than in the past.  And it seems kind of minor, but I think it will also likely really change the way that we think about being on the water.


        The same way that cold temperatures require pretty serious attention to how we're dressing, and how much time you're spending on the water, and the type of – the way that you're moving in and out of – or on and around the water and in and out of boats.  I think the same will likely become true for heat and I also kind of experienced that.  Yeah.


Q:        [49:43] When you say on a hotter day, does that change what you guys set up for work or are you just  – 


A:        [49:51] The issue is that it doesn't or it didn't in my experience.  And that means that people are in more risky environments or put in more risky scenarios.


        And – while that isn't necessarily about people's identities, of course that also – the idea of being perceived as capable impacts when people like – I'll just speak for myself because I should just do that.  On a really hot day I need to drink water and rest as most people do, but because I had this sense that I had to be kind of constantly proving my ability and strength, I was a lot less likely to take the rest that I needed, and to eat and drink what I needed, and also like use the bathroom which is actually a huge issue.


        I don't know if this has come up or other interviews, but huge issue in sea farming like on the Damariscotta in particular.  It's perennially something that's way more of a conversation topic than you think it would be.  But I just bring it up because like all of those basic care like tasks or that basic kind of relationship to care for one's body.  


        When you're in a position, or when I was in a position where I felt like I had to be proving my capacity all the time, and then you add an element of like extreme heat or extreme humidity or extreme cold, I put myself in risky scenarios and I strained my body a lot more than I needed to because of that.


Q:        [51:47] Jumping back to the adaptations that you make to deal with the changes.  What does it mean it’s possible for you to make those adaptations?  For example, are there any resources, relationships, knowledge, training or organizations that drew on to respond?        


A:        [52:10] Yeah, I didn't talk a lot about this so far, but the depth and variety of knowledge of this place of the estuary within or from a mariculture perspective, but also outside of that, just local knowledge of this place, is completely critical in trying to adapt.  And also in just understanding how things are changing.


        Like I know I mentioned it with tunicates, but it's also – ice is another good example.          There isn't a resource to – available to figure out like what's normal.  And so the sense of understanding local – a local perception of what's normal, or what was normal to certain people at a certain time is incredibly important.        


        Same thing with blue crabs, same thing with green crabs.  Same thing actually with just the presence of aquaculture in general.  Same thing with wild harvesting, whether it's oysters or clams especially, because that's a really hot topic.


        And then also just personally in the sense that you just can't get very far here without relationships to other folks on the river.


        So even the raft that I was working on I used to call it the Franken-raft, because there were probably at least five farms represented in the collage of gear that we had repurposed to create that raft.


        And it wasn't necessarily because the farm couldn't afford to buy a new gear.  Part of it is like, it holds this history of how this particular farm came into being, and all of the different relationships that made it possible for that farm to exist as it does now.  The scale that it does now.


        And a lot of that is unwritten and kind of underrepresented or kind of under appreciated and doesn't really– it's – a lot of it's invisible.  And that's also something that is challenging for folks who are new but also for women.  


        In fact, the two women on the river who I don't want to s – I'm not sure.  So I'm not going to name them probably, but they are two of the folks who've been working in an aquaculture on the river for the longest as business owners.  Neither of them own the businesses anymore.  And neither of them have good relationships or good rapport with the current business owners.  Not necessarily of their businesses or their foreign businesses but on the river in general.


        Like they don't come to the bar after work.  They're not – barely mentioned in local stories or in oyster farm tours.  Their names don't really appear in contemporary articles on women in aquaculture and women on the Damariscotta River and things like that.         That's a really interesting absence to me.


        And I bring it up because they are these vast resources of knowledge, and I think – and also incredibly intelligent in what they've – in their relationship.  Like they each have a unique relationship to oysters and to the river itself.  And I want to know what they have to say.  I want to know what they think, for example, about seeing blue crabs, or about ice, or about predation in general, or changes in seasons and climate.  But there's no route. They're not they're not accessible. 


        And there's a lot of reasons why even for me as someone who knows a lot of people on the river.  And they're not a part of the climate narratives like the Shellfish Growers Climate Coalition and other kind of groups of folks – groups of people organizing.  There are lots of women organizing across different types of mariculture and different fisheries.  But when it comes to the Damariscotta River and this local history, they're pretty much completely absent from – from those conversations in a visible way.


Q:        [57:25] Is that a choice they made or is that a reaction from the community?  Or maybe both?


A:        [57:36] Yeah, it's hard for me to assess because honestly, people speak highly of their knowledge but don't speak highly of them personally.  And I can only imagine kind of their – why that might be.  So like what their experiences were like trying to do what they were doing in a really male-dominated industry.  Well, either as scientists or – and/or as scientists and as working in aquaculture.


        And so they have reputations personally, which is really distressing to me I think, just because like – there's so much bad behavior.  Like so many of the men in this industry, I'm sure, have been like just as unpleasant or have been like just as rude, and have also been just as kind or just as insightful or just as caring.  But what stuck for them has been this kind of narrative.


        And I do feel it's important to state because they are truly so absent from contemporary understandings of this river in particular.  And this river is – when people talk about the history of the mariculture in Maine, this is always used as a starting point without them, or with their names kind of barely mentioned, which completely throws off the course of what you think the history or trajectory of how oyster farming in particular has developed in Maine.  


        So I don't know if that answered.


Q:        [59:24] What is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future of Maine’s coastal fisheries and aquaculture industries?


A:        [59:32] Yeah, that's a light question.  My biggest concern is that we won't make the drastic changes that we need to make soon enough.  


        So my biggest concern is that as people in the state of Maine, that we will continue trying to appease and compromise – and whereas I think we need to be making drastic changes now.


        That's my first response. I guess my biggest worry is also like a loss of knowledge and loss of relationship as things change at such a rapid pace.  And without like a critical eye to that, to documenting.  Once an organism is gone, what do we do?  And I don't think we're having enough conversations.  It’s not just about extinction or about extirpation, but I just don't think we're having enough conversations about the kind of intangible or invisible forms of knowledge and relationship that shape people's understanding of this place.  And then of course also shape people's livelihoods, however they imagine that.  And I think we really need to have those conversations too.


        And I just want to add the last thing, which is not – it's not the least important, but equity is huge.  I mean, yeah.  I'm really concerned by a trend, like I mentioned on the Damariscotta River where you once had women, your own some of the most impactful or powerful businesses on the river, and those have been sold to men.


        And it's not just about their gender, it's also about a trend towards more patriarchal forms of power, and a trend towards consolidating interests, and a trend towards commercialization.  Whereas what I would want and would hope to see is the opposite or how could we learn from that in the past and the way that that has happened, for example in like terrestrial agriculture, and do something different, not use that as a model.  And then continue to like intensify and extensify and further industrialize and corporatize the work that we're doing.


        And I just want to be careful there because I'm not suggesting that right now we're at this phase of mass industrialization.  It's more about the logic and structures and trajectory, and in particular what I'm concerned about is power in the way that patriarchy is operating within that trend.


Q:        [1:02:34] If you could tell policymakers in Maine what the biggest priorities should be to help people adapt to this, what would you tell them?


A:        [1:02:41] Access?  Access.  Yeah.  Physical access to coastal spaces, but it's also access to historic knowledge, access to economic resources, access to land, of course. 


        And I say that, but knowing that I just – I can't not think about indigenous sovereignty too. 


        So I'm not suggesting that like settler access would be the answer, but I think that means across the board.  So addressing access holistically. 


        So from indigenous rights and indigenous sovereignty first to also the fact that today there's maybe two public access points on the Damariscotta River or three.  And the reality is when you go up and down the river, most of those houses for most of the year are empty, which means – and not the public access points, but that means like most of this river, which is not an exception at all, is owned by people who are only here for a few months of the year.  


        And I don't I don't think that – I'm not suggesting that creating a working water front on the whole river is the answer – conserving the whole river is the answer, but just allowing people our right to like access land and water – public land and water – is a huge, huge necessity here and across the whole state.  Yeah.


Q:        [1:04:49] I'm going to switch to climate resilience strategies, focus questions.  Any purpose for (inaudible), any climate resilience or adaptation training or programs for the fishing industry or harvesting?


A:        [1:05:03] I don't know. I'm saying that because I really don't know.  I participated in programs like aquaculture and shared waters, and programs that are collaborations between all the various different industry groups.  And I would actually consider those climate resilience and adaptation trainings, but not explicitly.


F2:        [1:05:28] (inaudible) cut it really short, though.


Q:        [1:05:30] Thank you.


F:        [1:05:31] Thank you.


F2:         [1:05:32] (inaudible) shortly.


A:        [1:05:34] So sorry if I've talked too much.


Q:        [1:05:35] Oh, no.


F:        [1:05:36] It was so great.


Q:        [1:05:37] Just enough.


F:        [1:05:38] (inaudible) in 10 few minutes.  Maybe just move to hopeful vision after that.


Q:        [1:05:44] OK.  OK.


F:        [1:05:49] Thank you.  We're just sorry, not to interrupt.  You are saying about your different experiences.


A:        [1:05:53] No, just that I think – there are a lot of trainings and programs going on that aren't explicitly about climate resilience, but they are about climate resilience.  So I think that's important.


Q:        [1:06:08] What is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's coastal fisheries?


A:        [1:06:12] Oh, my hopeful vision.  It's beautiful. I mean, it's like diversified, diverse people and also our way of being with the ecology and space.  And it's not – we're not adhering to policies that create structures that promote industrialization or that promote like consolidation of interest and power.


        My hopeful vision is also one where there is indigenous sovereignty.  Wabanaki sovereignty.  And participation also therefore in how we're managing all public waters all across the state.  And in my hopeful vision, there's collaboration and cooperation and adaptability.


Q:        [1:07:15] Is there anything else you wanted to share with us?


A:        [1:07:20] There's probably so much I wanted to share.  I didn't talk a lot about being in like a differently able and disabled body.  And I won't go on now about it, but it is also something that shaped my experience.  And something that is inextricable from a lot of my beliefs about the type of work that I'm doing and also why I'm still drawn to working in sea farming.  It's people I’ve – when I decided to go to grad school and to leave, people saw that as me saying that I didn't want to like “make a career” out of aquaculture and there's so much emphasis on this idea of like training folks for career in a traditional style of employment in this weird in between of like fishing and agricultural kind of law and traditions.  


        And in some ways they're right because I don't want a traditional “career” in aquaculture, but it is the way that I want to live my life.  And it is how I think about my livelihood.  


        And as much as I spoke more about the negatives or the like difficult impact of being in like a gendered body and sexualized body in the space and a disabled body.  At the same time that's like why I love doing it because when – there's also the possibility that it's an incredibly empowering and accommodating and just like ecstatic kind of way of working.


Q:        [1:08:59] Do you have any questions, Camden?


F:        [1:09:02] No, so many but not now.  (laughter)


Q:        [1:09:05] (laughter).  Well, thank you, Anna.


A:        [1:09:06] Oh, thank you.  Thank you.        


END OF FILE"
"9","A: [0:00]        Although I guess how do you like to introduce yourself is a very vague way of – 


Q: [0:07]        Well, there's an easier warmup question.


A: [0:10]        I actually read that and I was like, what are they trying to get at that I'm missing?


Q: [0:13]        If you could do how do you like to spell your name, and then we can – 


A: [0:23]        OK.  I can spell my name, because it always gets spelled incorrectly.  So Seraphina, which is S-E-R-A-P-H-I-N-A.  Last name Erhart, E-R-H-A-R-T.


Q: [0:38]        Great.  So how do you like to introduce yourself is just sort of like how would you describe what you do?


A: [0:46]        (laughter) Like nothing else.  When I'm feeling funny, I will call myself the Seaweed Princess.  Generally, I use the title general manager, but what I do is so variable on the day, the time of year, who I'm interacting with.  If you're talking to students, it's going to be a different story than if you're talking to other businesspeople who know the industry and what you're interested in.


        I'm a desk jockey.  I don't get to go out onto the water.  But I basically take dried seaweed and figure out how to get it out into the world so that people eat it and get to appreciate it and be nourished by it, whether that's in their body or in their garden or feeding their pets or whatever version that looks like for them.  And all the things in between that involve supporting the harvesters that bring the product to us that we get to resell, supporting the environment that they make their living off of, that I make my living off of, supporting our employees, because I can't sell it and get it out the door if I don't have them involved.  So I also do a lot of things that are not about running this business, but are about being in the industry, from being an advisory member for the Maine Sea Grant Committee to being an active member of the Maine Seaweed Council in my own community.  I also decided to start a whole entire other business that has nothing to do with seaweed. (laughter) So that's a long answer.  But it's a lot of things.


Q: [2:30]        Could you tell me a little bit about where we are right now?


A: [2:35]        Sure.  We are in Hancock, Maine, about 17 miles from where we were founded in my parents' kitchen in 1971.  They moved from the kitchen after the wallpaper peeled off, because at that point, they were harvesting themselves, and the drying of the seaweed made all the old wallpaper peel off the house. (laughter) Then they moved into the barn, and then they moved about four miles away to a second building in 1993.


        And then we built this building in the winter of 2014 into '15 and that July moved in here.  So we're in 18,000 square feet of custom for us building, and just this year we ripped out our first wall to put in a new piece of equipment.  We hoped we might make it to 10 years.  We didn't quite make it that far, but pretty darn close.  We're also, what, two-thirds of the way up the Maine coast depending on where you are and how you know the state of Maine – not far from Acadia National Park.  I get to see Cadillac Mountain on my drive to work every morning.


Q: [3:47]        And can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A: [3:50]        Right here. (laughter) I have left and come back willingly.  I was born in Blue Hill, which is about 20 miles in the other direction from here.  I grew up in Franklin.  I went to middle and high school in Mount Desert Island, and then I left.  I went to college in Massachusetts.  I lived in southern Maine for a couple decades.  And then my dad started talking about retiring, and I came back.  I also had the privilege of growing up in the tide pools, which I didn't recognize for a really long time was a really special experience.  But now, I think it's – that part of being brought up in this business got into my nervous system, I think, in ways that I didn't even recognize until much later in life.  And walking in this building and smelling seaweed every day kind of calms me down and feels really good.  If I'm too far away from the ocean, I'm not a very nice person.  I definitely need to be close to the ocean.  Is that good?


Q: [5:00]        Yeah, absolutely.  Can you tell me a little bit about where your parents are from and what they did?


A: [5:06]        Yeah, I'm really lucky they're still both very much alive and kicking at 80 and 82.  Let's see.  My dad is from Cornwall, Connecticut.  My mother is from somewhere really near White River Junction, Vermont.  I'm not actually going to come up with the small town at the moment.  Most of my life – they started this business together, but my mother got out pretty early and realized that she couldn't be married and do the business at the same time.  She is an incredible organic gardener and spends most of her time somehow connected to the land, despite the fact that, of course, here in rural Maine in the winter, you can't always access the land.  And my father is still involved in the seaweed industry in a much more removed consulting basis through the Maine Seaweed Council, mostly, and with the state working on best practices with the DMR and hoping that we can get some regulatory stuff in place.


        Yeah, they didn't have a lot to do with the fisheries.  They met in grad school and dropped out together and traveled cross-country and tried to figure out where they wanted to settle and came here as part of the Back to the Lander movement.  And their interest in foraging and understanding food of where they lived is really a big part of how Maine Coast Sea Vegetables came to be.


Q: [6:44]        Do you have any siblings?


A: [6:46]        I do not – only child.


Q: [6:48]        And what year were you born?


A: [6:49]        1974.


Q: [6:51]        And you have talked about this a lot already, but is there anything you want to add about the history of fishing in your family?


A: [6:58]        My grandparents met fly-fishing, which has always struck me as really interesting. (laughter) I was raised as a vegetarian, and I've often thought because of my love of the water and the very meditative practice that fly-fishing has always struck me as, that if I had not been raised as a vegetarian, I'm pretty sure I would have followed suit.  But yeah, I don't come from many generations of fishing in this family, and also being a woman and not having that history when I came back here to work for this business – that was one of my father's concerns was how that was going to go down with the suppliers who are all very much multigenerational fishing families.  Turns out family trumps everything for them pretty much.  Like I have not had that experience, which I'm eternally grateful for.


Q: [8:04]        Sure.  And again, in this context, it's kind of an interesting question, but do you have any history of family working in other roles in the fishing industry, such as bookkeeping, processing, marketing?


A: [8:17]        Yeah, other than my parents being like the early harvesters and the early marketers and all the beginning phases of getting this business off the ground, no.


Q: [8:28]        Are you married?


A: [8:29]        No.


Q: [8:30]        Do you have any children?


A: [8:31]        No.  Or I have 24 employees. (laughter)


Q:        How would you describe your role in fishing and the aquaculture industry in Maine?


A: [8:46]        I don't consider myself part of aquaculture.  However, I value what aquaculture is bringing to our state, and I know that aquaculture needs to be a part of this business's reality in order to be able to expand beyond the wild harvesting that we've been doing.  Seaweed, in my opinion, has a unique story amongst the fisheries in Maine, in that we've managed to stay on the side of taking care of the environment in which it exists.  I don't believe that there's over-harvesting happening, in part because there are a handful of businesses who have been around almost as long as we have – 50-plus years of doing it in the same areas in a respectful way that seems to be responsible resource management, even though we have no legal requirements.  We have to buy a license from the state, that's it.


        So there's a lot of reasons to be cautious going forward, especially as seaweed becomes a bigger interest in the state, in the fishing world, in our food system.  And I think if we're not careful, we're going to tip that scale pretty quickly.  So it's part of why we're pushing really hard to work with the DMR to create our own – how should I phrase this?  We want regulation, but we want regulation in consultation.  We don't want to be part of the we were regulated because we frigged it up.


        So the question was how do I see myself in the seaweed and aquaculture or the fisheries and aquaculture world?  I see myself as part of the solution, I hope – that Maine Coast Sea Vegetables and its history can use that history to help tell a good story and keep seaweed in a positive light and also hopefully be cautious.  We're a model of slow growth.  And I think that if you can stay in that and out of a lot of more traditional, commercial-scale – well, it's not – commercial-scale is not right, because we're commercial-scale.  But there's a way in which it can grow to the point where you're not looking at the resource anymore.  You're only looking at the value of what you're taking and how that is going to feed your family, not all the steps in between.  So I don't know how successful we'll be, but if we're not in the middle and we're not part of the conversation, then I'm sure it's not going to go well.  We'll see if we can have any positive influence.


Q: [11:48]        Great.  I'm going to come back to that, but just briefly – and again, these questions are funny.  We've talked about it a little already.  But I would love if you could just describe how you came into this work.


A: [11:57]        In utero.  It's in my blood.  Sometimes when we start Seaweed Council meetings, someone will ask a prepper question as we go around and introduce ourselves and ask like what brought you here or why is this important to you, and I usually say because it's literally in my blood.  As an American without Asian genetics, I am probably one of the few who was born and raised and has the digestive enzymes to eat seaweed in the volume that I do.  I lost the question.  You're going to have to try that again. (laughter) 


Q: [12:36]        Absolutely.  If you could just describe how you got into this work.


A: [12:39]        OK.  So I got into this work by having the family connection, but in actuality, I chose to come back and invest in being here, because I'd had my own experience in the entrepreneurial world that did not go so well, mixed with my father talking about selling the business or moving on.  And as we've discussed, I don't have siblings, so it was me or nothing. I came back thinking that I was going to be the outside sales rep for the company and travel New England and get to talk about – so I've always loved seaweed.  That wasn't ever the question.


        I got here and realized that was not what this company needed – that there was a whole bunch of long-term, dedicated employees who were terrified, because my father kept saying he was going to retire, but there was no plan.  And I think they all literally thought one day he was going to walk in and be like, OK, I'm out.  Good luck.  And we were growing at a rate at that point where a lot of the infrastructure that we had wasn't keeping up with the needs of the company.  So I often – this building is a good example, but there's been a lot of less visible ways in which we've been shoring up the infrastructure.  When you've got a business that's been around this long, that's as grassroots as we are, I'm often talking about how I feel like I'm shoving the foundation back under the existing business – you know, that model of you're building a plane and flying a plane at the same time.  We are actively doing that on a daily basis here. (laughter) Not entirely sure I'm answering your question the way you want, but here we go.


Q: [14:25]        No, it's great.  Can you talk a little bit more about your experience, and your experience inherently is beyond fishing and harvesting.  I have a few ways that question is broken up, so maybe those are good access points.  Sort of experience with bookkeeping or gear preparation – if you have any of that – experience in post-harvest processing, which you have tons of experience in, or experience in advocacy.  You've talked a little bit about that.  But if you could break all of those things down – and I'm happy to ask this question (multiple conversations; inaudible).


A: [14:57]        Yeah, you're going to probably have to break that up for me.  So not so much in the bookkeeping, although I do all of our organic record-keeping for both this company and for four of our main suppliers.  That's not numbers, but it's a whole lot of documentation.  And I have a heavy hand in all of our FDA food safety regulatory requirements as well.


        Post-harvest processing – yeah, once it's dry, I've done a lot of things with it. (laughter) I have spent some time out on the water.  I have had my own harvesting license at times just so that we can go out and do training and experimental stuff with employees, or for other reasons at different times it's made sense. I get to go out for the harvest inspections every year.  That's usually my one foray out there.  But it also helps that we have a regular connection.  Even though those harvesters are not our employees, we talk about them, many of them, as though they are part of our operation, because we work so closely with them.  And in about half the cases, we are their only seaweed buyer.  So it really is that close of a dependency.


        They bring us dry stuff.  We do all kinds of things.  We mill it, we mix it.  We do a lot of quality control.  That's probably primarily what we do.  We market it, we put it in pretty packages or less-pretty packages and ship it back out the door to whoever wants it.  And they do make fancy pet foods with it or put it in their bath or eat it or probably all kinds of things I don't even know about.  And then there was a third part of that.


Q: [16:54]        Yeah, experience in advocacy or community-based conversation.


A: [16:57]        That's probably the newer aspect.  Turns out when you run a company that's been around for a long time in an industry that's growing rapidly, you get asked to join a lot of things.  And I have days where I wish I had more time for that.  Mostly it's through, as I mentioned before, the Maine Seaweed Council, being a program advisory member for the Maine Sea Grant and representing the seaweed industry in that world.  And then sometimes in unique environments, people will invite me or someone here to come speak or participate.  But those are the regular ones.


Q: [17:42]        Can you talk a little bit more about what that involvement looks like?


A: [17:45]        Yeah.  With Sea Grant, it's interesting, because I feel like it's just as – I get just as much from it as I feel like I give, if not more, because I so enjoy being in a room with so many other – both industry, but definitely ocean-based thinking people in all the ways in which that can be.  And you get to see the interconnectedness of all those pieces and how it impacts the state of Maine through that filter of all of us being in a room with maybe a particular topic.  I mean, it changes all the time.


        So yes, I'm there with like thinking about how the seaweed part of that and our fishery is part of the whole state, but I appreciate also being reminded that we're just one of many pieces.  So it's more of that larger ecosystem thinking in an entirely different realm.  And we sometimes get to go to really cool places, which never breaks my heart, right? (laughter) Experience helps it all.


        With the Seaweed Council, that's evolving a lot – the industry growth.  So they celebrated 30 years in existence this past June.  And I'm actually actively engaging with at least a portion of that membership to do a strategic plan, because I think the industry growth is happening much faster than the small volunteer organization can manage.  Talk about advocacy – we're getting asked to participate in and educate in all sorts of ways.  And we want that.  We want seaweed to be a good news story.  There are plenty of people out there trying to badmouth the industry as fast as we're trying to not or educate and put regulations that protect us all in place.  


        So we're discussing like how does the growth of the Seaweed Council meet the needs of the growing industry in order to be supportive of the state and of people who want to enter the fishery, and also not accidentally look like what we're actually doing is supporting so much unsustainable growth?  Because I think there are a lot of people who are questioning that right now on the aquaculture or the wild harvest side, both.  I don't know that our state is the right environment for the scale at which people are talking about some forms of aquaculture here.  And when people reach out and tell me, for example, that they want to know how many metric tons do we think we could reasonably harvest, because they want to turn seaweed into a plastic alternative – I'm all for plastic alternative.  I'm not all for decimating what exists before we even understand the consequences or the possibilities.  So yeah, I'm a little afraid of the chicken and the egg or the cart and the horse, whatever that is. (laughter) I think everybody's really excited about the possibility.  I'm not so sure that there's enough attention being paid to what's actually happening in the industry and its ability to keep up with all the potential.


Q: [21:32]        Could you describe what an average day of work looks like for you?


A: [21:36]        There's no such thing running a small business.  It's not a thing.  Variety.  Yeah, rolling with whatever comes.  Lately – well, lately – the last four years, it's been kind of a game of who shows up and what can we get done.  It's a triage of none of us exist if the product doesn't go out the door, so that's always top priority.  So most of the time, I'm answering emails and dealing with the management of a business, but some days that is not the top priority, and I'm out there processing product with whoever happens to be around, which I actually kind of enjoy sometimes.  And other days, you've got a deadline and you've got people coming to visit, and you waltz in and there's a whole bunch of unexpected things, and it can be a little stressful, too.


        An average day – it seems like such a simple question.  I don't have that kind of routine where – I know running a boat – a lobster boat, for example, will come with variety, too, because your engine might go down or any number of other things.  So there's a level at which that applies, I think, always, where problem-solving is 100% a big part of the day job.  It's just am I problem-solving on a screen?  Am I problem-solving because a piece of equipment's gone down?  Am I problem-solving because I've got employees not talking to each other?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know that I can do better than that for an answer.


Q: [23:29]        What are some responsibilities you have to fill pretty routinely?  Maybe that's a different way of thinking about it.


A: [23:37]        Yeah, there's sort of like the categories of things that I – so we have, I think, 13 suppliers of seaweed raw material specifically, but six of them are like family-scale operations, and I have a lot of regular contact with them.  So that's a sort of sizable, regular part of my life.  But it has a bit of a rhythm to it, because of course the seaweed is only actually harvested – depending on the species, you know, March to July/August or maybe June to September/October.  So that will ramp up throughout the summer.


        Right now, all of the organic documentation for all the operations is in process, and between now and May, that'll all get completed.  So that's like five mini-research projects that are happening in the background.  Then there's all that extra stuff we're talking about.  Like today was a bunch of emails back and forth getting ready for a Seaweed Council meeting, and that's pretty normal.  Or making plans because of lovely humans like you who want to come and talk to us, or I had another PhD student on the West Coast who wants to interview us for a different purpose.  I would say twice a month there's something like that that's coming across our desk in some fashion.


        Backing up the customer service team with the really weird, gnarly, unusual things, because we have a joke here that we're 1-800-SEAWEED. (laughter) I think we're one of the more visible for human consumption US-based seaweed companies.  So when people are confused or looking for answers, we get a lot of really interesting things coming across our desk. 


        Working with our science advisor on whatever.  You know, he's always sort of helping us improve many different types of systems.  Right now, we're gathering samples for all of our annual testing that we do once a year.  Working with the sales team on whatever weirdnesses they've got.  Triage of all the different departments I think is part of how that general manager hat works, right?  The production manager and I pretty much spend a chunk of time every day.  The accounts department, same deal.  There's always some level of HR going on behind the scenes of all of it.  Yeah, I think the better question might be what isn't in my purview. (laughter) Yeah, too much.  It's not the same every day, but there's rhythms and pieces that are sort of ongoing all the time.


Q: [26:33]        Great.  And you touched on this a little already, but do you hold any commercial licenses?


A: [26:36]        I do not personally.  The business has its food facility license.  And I have had a harvesting license, but I do not at the moment – yeah, both for the Maine Department of Ag and then for the federal FDA.  And then our organics isn't a license, but it is an annual inspection.


Q:[27:05]        And how do you feel that your background or identity shapes your work, including how others perceive or treat you?


A: [27:15]        Oh, interesting.  So off the recording, we talked about my background in art, and I think that one of the things I've sort of been taking in more and more is the fact that I approach just about everything from a creative problem-solving, which can be really helpful and sometimes makes it really hard to work with the spreadsheet, money, everything is linear and fits in a box.  I do not exist in that universe.  But we need each other, right?  I have to remind them that everything that they see on a screen is not all that there is, and I need to be reminded that that is also a practical part of running a business.  You have to always know what all the buckets have in them, whether we're talking about inventory or cash or whatever it is.  There are times when I think it's really helpful that that creative background allows me to move in and out of all these things, but I also get overwhelmed by it, because I have too many things that I'm trying to hold and keep and problem-solve all at the same time.  So it's a blessing and a curse.  I'm not sure I answered your question accurately, though.


Q: [28:40]        Well, I'm curious.  You had mentioned earlier when you were talking about coming back to this business, sort of your positionality among these harvesters who have this family history and your position as a woman entering this industry.  Can you talk a little bit more about that?


A: [28:55]        Yeah, I know it's a thing.  I'm not sure if I don't allow it to be a thing or if they don't see it as a thing, honestly.  I mean, it's not that I've never experienced being treated as less than because I'm a woman, but I have not experienced that within the fisheries side of this.  I've experienced it with technicians who come to fix a piece of equipment and treating me like I couldn't possibly know what I'm talking about.  I experienced it a little bit in working with the bazillion contractors in building this facility.  I helped design the facility.  I knew what the plan was.  I understood what the workflow needed to be.  I knew what the priorities were.  But I didn't always get that level of respect in that environment.


        But when I'm dealing with the harvesters and out on the water, I don't have that, thankfully.  I get partly maybe because they've all worked with my dad, and they learned from him and they understood that this company in their land of seaweed being one of the few fisheries and being way ahead of it – being one of the few fisheries that they got to participate in yearly, that it was a meaningful part of their annual income.  So I think that in and of itself just sort of gave us, and therefore me, some ground to stand on without having to prove myself all the time.


        More recently, as the seaweed industry in Maine is growing and as aquaculture is having such a light shed on it at the international level, what I keep hearing is how many intense and powerful women are involved in the seaweed industry. (laughter) I'm not dumb.  I'm pretty sure I'm one of those.  I'm definitely not a quiet person.  My version might look differently.  I'm not a public speaker.  I'm not like a seaweed's going to save the world kind of person.  I'm more of a like, we're here, and we're here to stay.  I think this is meaningful.  And I think we have something really important to contribute to our food systems and to our ability to grow the population and still feed each other nutritious food and not completely devastate the soil.  Not sure if that is answering your question either.


Q: [31:31]        Yeah, absolutely.  And I'd love to hear – do you think there are a lot of strong, powerful women in seaweed?


A: [31:37]        There are definitely a few in this state. (laughter) Yeah, I've met quite a few, and I think there's probably more that I don't know.  It's certainly not the only people, but I would say a lot of the newer generation of industry businesspeople are – seemingly a lot of women out there.  When other people have asked me variations on that question, one of the things that comes up for me is I think we're generally more willing to collaborate.  And in an industry that's new and growing and you can't pick something off the shelf and apply it, you kind of have to figure it out, I suspect that there's a reason that we're being successful, because we're more willing to communicate with each other and work with each other and learn and share and not like – yes, there may be my competition at some level on paper, but there's a lot of room in this sector still, and I think that we're better together.  And if we are all on some similar page in terms of the type of story we want to tell about the industry, then this is more of the tide rises all boats situation than pointing fingers and trying to keep it for ourselves.  I have no idea how accurate that is, but it's the sense of who I get to work with on a regular basis.


Q: [33:07]        Do you think there's something specific to seaweed that sort of draws women to it?


A: [33:12]        Oh, that's a really interesting question.  Maybe.  But then again, my first instinct is, well, we're driven by the moon, right?  You can only harvest wild seaweeds at the biggest new moon and full moon tides.  As humans, our blood is very similar to all the micronutrients that are in the seaweeds.  So I've always felt like there's a similarity and attraction there for people who are interested in channeling that or paying attention to it.  Maybe in that sort of general way that – not everybody, but I find more women willing to slow down enough to pay attention to more of that level of nuance and maybe be willing to accept they don't know everything, that there is stuff to learn from the environment around them.


        In a very reverse sexism-type statement, I don't find too many men able to do that.  Their nervous system and the way they've been raised in this culture primarily feeds this dialogue that they are meant to dominate everything, which tends to also, in my experience, not allow them to just be present, to just listen, to pay attention to the more subtle aspects.  So maybe.


Q: [35:03]        Yeah, absolutely.  Thank you.  Can you describe any changes in the marine environment, maybe in product or any other way that you've noticed?


A: [35:12]        Yeah, it's subtle, and what I would say is it's not like a linear experience.  So for example, a couple of our species, when I look back at our decades of buying history, I can see that like every three to five years, they'll have a falloff and then they'll have a really big boom, and that has stayed to be the case.  But what I'm seeing in the last decade is it seems like all of the species are having more of a variety in that way.  You know, there's some theories about different – like last year, for example, it rained all through May and June.  And that meant we didn't have as much sunlight.  It was really slow growth.  The water got warmer faster.  The salinity was way down.  It increased biofouling.  And we didn't get as much what we would consider first-quality food-grade product at the time of year that we would have expected.  Each species has its own growing cycle and its own way of being.  The sugar kelp that meant they didn't get very much harvest, because once it gets to the point where it's sporing and looks ratty and horrible – sometime in late June to mid-July depending on how it goes – they're done for the season, and then we're just working with what we have.


        Whereas with the dulse, all the hundreds of females that become a full frond every on average two-week cycle, it looks like junk through July because of all that fresh water.  It was creating all this microalgae on the surface that we call gray leaf, and it just looks like the dulse has molded.  It's fine if we mill it and we're turning it into a powder, and it can still be used, but we can't pay top dollar for it.  There's a whole bunch more labor that goes into it.  So it's discouraging for the harvesters.  It's discouraging for us.  It changes what we can sell or how we can sell it.  But then September rolled around, and we had all this late fall, gorgeous, perfect dulse, but the season's really short at that point.


        So yeah, it's changing, but it's not like every year I'm seeing the same type of pattern.  What I can say is every year the pattern is really drastically different.  And sometimes, it's pretty explainable and it's a pattern we've seen a decade before, and it's just that's how it's going.  Some things, it seems like the season's extending.  Other things, it seems like the season's shortening.  I think the most consistent part is that it is inconsistent. (laughter)


        You know, I was today on the phone with two different harvesters, and they're both – I hope they're only looking at it from what they didn't make in income, which is completely understandable.  But they've also been working with us now for so many decades that they really see that impact when it happens multiple years in a row for various reasons.  A couple years ago, the kelp in particular – we're pretty sure that we had a lot of ice that winter and it was warm later, so the spores settled much later.  And we're – one, a couple of people are theorizing that that particular winter, all the spores were so microscopic, they got scraped off by the ice, whereas if they'd gotten bigger because they'd settled sooner, they might have survived more of that experience.  Because it just wasn't there that spring, which is very, very unusual.  So yes, change.  What the change is?  Got nothing. (laughter) 


Q: [39:02]        How are you seeing the impact of those changes?


A: [39:07]        Well, this is where what I do in the middle is probably the hardest to manage right now.  I've been thinking a lot about the realities of, for example, things like Whole Foods, which as it evolved into what it is now for years and years and years was a huge part of our industry model.  We are a food that appeals to the type of person who at least 10 years ago I would have said primarily would go shopping at a place like Whole Foods.  I don't think that applies anymore.  When Amazon bought it out, Maine Coast Sea Vegetables vanished from Whole Foods in a lot of parts of the country, which was a huge blow for us and for our customer base.


        And the primary reason is because we exist in more of a CSA-type model, where my sales are not because there's demand.  My sales are because that's what got harvested and that's what's out there in our warehouse to be sold.  Obviously, we do our best to keep stuff year-round.  We change our sales rhythm – not has nothing to do with the harvest rhythm, but we we try to let the harvest happen and then make our plan for the sale so that we're always sort of able to adapt.  But we're working in an environment which beyond us, everybody wants consistency.  They want to fill that shelf, and it's about turnover rate, and it's about you can always provide them what they want, and they don't understand or frankly care what happened out on the bay, what happened for the harvesters, what Mother Nature did that year.  Just provide it.  That's kind of it.


        I don't know.  I mean, I think the aquaculture or seaweed industry is working to try to change that story, which may be good.  Maybe we'll have a handful of species that we can consistently provide all the time in the volume that those types of larger-scale stores and environments need.  And then I can imagine a version in which Maine Coast Sea Vegetables – it really is more of a CSA.  If you're from Maine and you know what fiddleheads are, it's a seasonal thing, and some things we'll only get in small batches and it'll be available until it's gone, and then we'll have this other line that supports us year-round.  Right now, I'm trying to support 20-plus internal year-round employees with whatever happens.  So I can't have it just sell out all the time and then have nothing to do for a couple of months.  We had one spring like that by accident.  It is unpleasant on so many levels.


        Your question was about what's changing, right?


Q: [42:03]        And how those different environmental changes have impacted your work.


A: [42:07]        Right.  So it's impacting our work, because we're really having to change how we think about sales here.  We can't play the game that those big chain stores want us to play, or participate in all the incredible – you know, discount, free giveaway, all that stuff.  We don't sell widgets.  We don't sell highly processed food.  We sell something that is wild and natural and unique and different all the time, and different in its volume all the time as well.


        So I think it's possible, but talk about taking creativity.  You can't just apply – you know, I've got two people who are always like, I just want an answer, and it applies to all the things.  I'm like, you do not work for that company.  I'm so sorry. (laughter) It's not going to happen.  Whether we're talking about the suppliers – they've all got slightly different variations on themes – or how we sell each species or – yeah.


Q: [43:04]        And is there anything that you've tried to sort of respond to the changes that you're seeing with all of this?


A: [43:10]        Yeah, shifting to more direct to the consumer sale than we used to do.  Thinking about more connection to other types of seasonal businesses – for example, like a area restaurant or a summer camp or something that's going to handle that more farm-to-table thinking.  Creating products that we can supply in volume year-round that are somewhat seaweed-based but not solely seaweed-based, so that we can also have some factor of that sort of consistent product that goes into a store but also income volume and workload volume here.


        We have four customer groups.  It used to be that distribution, which is basically 10 retail items going out to stores, was 75% of our income.  That's not the case anymore, and it's unrealistic – and it's probably healthier that it is not the case anymore.  But it takes a long time to adjust.  None of these things happen as quickly as the changes are happening.  So I can feel already that this year, sales cycles are different.  The harvesters are already starting to get itchy and looking for me to tell them what they want.  I haven't even sold through most of 2023's product yet.  So you can get kind of caught between both realities while you're trying to change how you think about sales and what they want you to buy.  It's a little bit of a shell game and risk. (laughter) But dried seaweed is beautiful like that.  It lasts a long time.


Q: [45:09]        Yeah, and have you made, to that point, any changes in sort of how you're processing the seaweed?


A: [45:13]        Yeah.  Well, sadly, two years in, it isn't actually fully functional yet.  We got some DMR grant funding to automate one of our product lines to help.  At the time, largely we were having employee turnover like never before and higher volume of sales of that particular line.  And it was one of the few things that we could automate here, with the goal that it can produce more in the same week with the same number of people, but reduce the actual workload.  It's pretty minor in the big picture of things, but it feels pretty monumental to us, because we've been very manual for a long time.  Seaweed destroys equipment.  It's so salty.  So the only way I was going to invest in something like that was when somebody else paid for it, because it's a very unproven process. (laughter) I would not be surprised if you called back in 10 years and I'm like, yeah – no, that's rusted out.


Q: [46:17]        Yeah, and these combinations of changing the way you sort of assess sales and also work with the processing – do you think that those have helped you be able to address these shifts in seaweed each year?


A: [46:27]        Some of them, yeah.  Some of them is also just purely educating the customer and getting people to understand.  I'd say 30% to 50% of any given day of our customer service team work can be along the lines of it's a wild product.  I know it doesn't look or taste or feel or whatever exactly the same as the last bag you bought from us.  That's an unrealistic expectation.  This is not greenhouse-grown, uniform tomatoes or any other things.


        The other part is we get scrutinized more like we're a supplement company, in that that's how people look at seaweeds in a lot of cases.  So that's a different side of the challenge, in that I'm realizing – I'm not realizing.  We've known this for a long time.  But it seems to be expanding.  People ask questions as though we're closer to a healthcare practitioner than somebody who might stock the shelves in the grocery department.  You're not going to ask them the same level of scrutinized questions about the sweet potato you're buying and expect them to know that, but they expect us to know that.


        So it's challenging to figure out how to meet all those different dynamics, right?  You've got all these people who want all the testing information, nutritional information.  They want to know what the right amount is or the best tasting or all these other aspects.  And I think that boils down to it's new.  It's definitely on the higher end of cost.  And maybe they understand that it's healthy for them, but they don't know what to do with it.  Somehow if they can scrutinize us and get to know us at that level, maybe it'll create trust.  I don't really know.  I mean, certainly the model we take is we're going to give you as much information as we can so you can make your own good decisions and try to be transparent.


        To your question of like has it helped us change?  I think we are changing, in that we are realizing that that's just the nature of who our customer base is always going to be.  So we're actually in the process of looking at rebranding – refreshing our brand after all these decades.  A lot of these discussions are around like we're grounded in the health food – seaweed for your health world.  That's how my parents started this company.  Maybe we want to reframe how we talk about it so that we're acknowledging that, but we're not necessarily promoting it as much so that we can pack a little bit away from being so close to the medical industry. (laughter) FDA also doesn't love that.


Q: [49:27]        Sure.  And I'm curious – you mentioned the grant that you were able to automate.  Is there anything else that's been really useful in sort of helping you adapt to these really dramatic swings in product, like what you have access to year by year and are working with?


A: [49:42]        Yeah, in 2020 – we never got the training, because it was the pandemic, but we moved ourselves into an automated sales and inventory system.  It took almost three years to really trust it.  But our sales impact our inventory, so we can sort of always look at how that's going in a way that makes us able to answer questions quicker and understand, yes, we can fulfill that.  That's unrealistic.  That's really changed the sales volume.  When you're only doing quarterly or bi-yearly large-scale inventories, it's harder to be as responsive when new customer inquiries come in.  So to feel like we have a handle on that at any given point in any given day is really helpful.


Q: [50:35]        Do you feel like you've been able to adapt in the ways that you want?


A: [50:40]        (laughter) Some.  You can only realistically run a company and change so many things and be efficient and keep your employees engaged/not angry about it at any given time.  Every decision has a ripple effect and creates change all up and down the whole process.  So someone will come who works in a different part of the company and have what to them is a really good idea, because they're looking at this one aspect of it, and that's fine.  But it gets challenging, because usually – occasionally you luck out and it's like, yeah, of course.  Go forth!  But a lot of times you have to pause and go, OK, that's a great idea, but let's look at how that choice will impact all these other things.  That takes time, and it can be frustrating, because if you're not holding the whole picture – you're only doing this one particular job – it just feels like I'm always the bearer of bogged-down, slow responsiveness.  So I think we've done a pretty good job.  I also am aware that if I took that same question around the building, I probably would get a very different set of answers, which says we're doing some of it.


Q: [52:09]        I'm just thinking – one thing we haven't said, but I know at least, is that you're an employee-owned enterprise here, right?


A: [52:16]        Yeah.


Q: [52:17]        So I was just thinking – how does that factor into making changes to a company, when it's not a sole proprietary kind of ownership model?


A: [52:26]        Yeah, thank you for bringing that up.  In 2017, my father sold this company to the employees, and we became 100% employee-owned.  The way we structured it is myself and one other primary manager have 51% of that so that the employees can't earn enough shares and sell it out from under us, because apparently that's happened.


        But also because I am the second generation, I still feel pretty regularly like the expectation is everybody sees me as running the company, which I find interesting, because I feel like all I do is work to make sure that that's not the perception.  Yeah, somebody has to have their Social Security number on everything and their neck stuck out a little farther than everybody else to take responsibility to have a business and have the loan to finance this building and all the other things that come with it.  But we also are a consensus management group, so the hope is that that will level out.


        However, I'm learning in hindsight that not everybody is good at collaboration.  (laughter) We've had change in that management group, and it's fine.  It's a good learning experience.  But it's also been really eye-opening at how much that change has created change in our daily sort of way we're working through.


        But I will say that the upside is that it does create an environment in which the employees I think for the most part feel like they're welcome and wanted to have an opinion, which is why I think I also have such a hard time not just being able to do all the things that come.  I wish that I didn't have all these other things on my desk a lot of days so that I could focus on creating the changes that they want, because a lot of them are super-valid or at least getting to a point where they really understand why we're not doing it that way, so that they're bought into the process that is in existence, because there is usually a reason.  But it's kind of really impossible to do both well.  You're either kind of managing the daily or the rest of the company.  And we're at that scale where we're doing both, and it's mixed experiences.


Q: [54:58]        So what is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future for Maine's fisheries and aquaculture industries?


A: [55:06]        Oh, depends on the day.  If I'm talking to somebody who's really worried about legislature or the lack thereof, it can be that right now, the only thing stopping someone coming from international waters and paying a $250 fee to buy a harvesting license, and all they have to do is report to the DMR – everything could be gone in the seaweed world.  I mean, everything is an over-exaggeration, because the way seaweed grows – it's actually, I think, impossible.  It gets in all the crevices and all the places, you know?  If you've ever been to a rocky shoreline, you know that's not actually possible.  It's not trees.  You're not clearcutting in that way.  But they could definitely do damage.  So that's one version.


        Our warming waters and all the very scary stories that – if you're paying attention to anything scientific in this state, you're aware that our waters are warming faster than the rest of the world, which is terrifying, and what that is going to do to the whole ecosystem – not just seaweed specifically, but the interconnectedness of it all.  I think seaweeds have the capacity to adapt, but they may be slower to adapt than the water warms.  I don't know.  And maybe there are ways in which they are dependent on other parts of the ecosystem in which they live that will be more problematic than anybody recognizes right now.


        I think we kind of joke on a regular basis that seaweed is sort of the bastard child of the fisheries, of the science and research money, of a lot of the things.  One of the assets to all the interest in aquacultured seaweed is that more money for research projects has come available in the last decade.  So we've moved the needle pretty significantly in a couple of important areas.  But yeah, it's still a long ways off.  We don't have the kind of information that a lot of the other fisheries have when it comes to food safety, when it comes to understanding its lifecycle and its interdependence on a lot of other things.


        Food safety is another one.  We don't have a lot of information on that when it comes to seaweed, and a couple bad stories and it could be a really bad situation for all this new energy and turn a lot of people off.  And there's a lot of good things happening, but there's a lot of lack of awareness in that realm as well.  


        There's probably more, but that's enough worst-case scenarios.  I don't like to live in worst-case scenarios.  It's not my comfort zone.


Q: [58:08]        Have you personally noticed any change from the warming water?


A: [58:13]        I don't know if this is factual or not.  What I have noticed is more customer complaints about things like our Alaria not having as much of the outer soft frond and being more midrib than it is actual leaf.  I'm unconvinced if that's accurate, but it is interesting that like for the last three years or so, that seems to have been a pattern I hear more that I don't ever remember.  And these are people who – you know, I can prove they've been buying from us since the '80s.  So they're on to something.  Is it that they got later in the year product before?  Is that a different harvester?  There's a lot of variables there.  I don't think I could definitively say, yeah, this, this, and this are really different.  Periwinkles seem to be more.  Bryophytes seem to be more.  The microalgae that creates the gray leaf that makes it so that we're only able to use it as a milled product seems to be coming earlier.  And from year to year, even that will change.


Q: [59:33]        Sure.  And if you could tell policymakers in Maine what the biggest priority should be to adapt to all these changes you're seeing, what would you tell them?


A: [59:42]        Oh, boy.  It's probably something bigger than I think.  Like I was saying before about liking to be in that room with all the various minds that come together to act as the advisory panel for Sea Grant, I appreciate that because it gets me out of my own microcosm.  I'm also right now taking a leadership course through the Maine Center for Entrepreneurs in a similar vein of just wanting to connect with other industries and small businesses in the state, but in a lot of different sectors and not just in the fisheries sector.  Because we are experiencing different things, and maybe we have more things to learn from each other than anyone else could be aware of.  But because we all sort of live in our own lane, we're not thinking that way.


        So when it comes to the policymaking part of it, it's probably like four stories up in a way that I'm not thinking that is a bigger umbrella of change that would impact us in the immediacy of it.  And here in this state – or even maybe it would be better at the federal level, although I have a lot of trepidation about that, because you cannot talk about seaweed as one item and do it justice.  Every single species has its own lifecycle, its own need for propagation, its own way of working when it comes to harvesting appropriately.  And if we just made a policy for seaweed, the way it often gets talked about, we're going to do the industry and the future a humongous disservice.  And I have limited faith that at the federal level, that's a thing that could happen well right now.


        So I think for the moment at least, we're better off at a state-by-state environment, because at least then we're understanding what's in our own backyard.  At that level, I think it would be to really understand here – pay for biomass assessments, understand where our starting point is, and actually know in real time what people are harvesting and where they are, so that they're not overlapping each other.  And maybe we do need to have quotas or we need to create, you know, in a certain area, a certain amount.


        I don't know what the right answer is.  That's way above my pay grade.  I do not have enough letters and acronyms after my name for that. (laughter) But there are a lot of people out there who do and are interested in it.  I think we're capable.  There's no money to do it.  There's not enough interest.  We're not the lobster industry.  So I don't know how we get from here while we're still doing things pretty well to the place where there's enough money and interest and understanding of the need in order to make it happen.  I worry that there's a disconnect there between those two realities that we have to be so far down the pike that we maybe will have already done too much damage in order to have enough awareness and enough funding and all the things that go with it.  So I don't know.  Policymakers, get your head out of your ass and figure it out. (laughter)


Q: [1:03:03]        Do you think there are resources that seaweed as an industry has that are useful in sort of helping towards those goals?


A: [1:03:12]        Sure.  I mean, we do have – at the international level, there is definitely some level of knowledge and awareness that could be utilized.  However, at the international level, you also don't have the level of scrutiny for food quality and some other things that we have intrinsically here in the US.  So a lot of people are like, oh, you can learn that from Korea.  Well, yeah, I can learn some things.  And then again, different species, different environment, different water, different shorelines, different ways in which all the fisheries interact with each other.  You put an aquaculture line out here in a lobster bay, and you've got a lot of people down at the pier who want to cut your lines and are basically saying you're planting a garden where they want to lobster.  So I don't know how we do better at working together.


Q: [1:04:11]        And have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training or programs?


A: [1:04:16]        I read a lot of things and I interact with a lot of people who do, but I am not actively doing it myself.


Q: [1:04:26]        And what strategies do you think would be effective for building resilience against climate-related impacts for seaweed?


A: [1:04:33]        Hmm.  This may not be relevant, but I keep going back to reevaluating our entire model of how we think about selling food in this country.  Because that's way beyond seaweed.  That's just like – it's a climate problem, right?  The way we manage food and this mass volume of anything that we're talking about – the monoculture of it all is not healthy for our planet and therefore for us.  I think that some level of that should also be applied to whatever the growth of the seaweed industry is.


        My latest Maine seaweed soapbox is something along the lines of seaweed is not kelp.  Kelp is a seaweed.  We are only growing kelp on a line here in the state when we talk about seaweed aquaculture.  But the majority of the public does not understand that.  They are all the same thing.  So there's an education component to it for sure, but we need to expand beyond that.  We have to expand the many – we sell nine species under this roof, and that's part of the privilege of working in the wild world, and those are all coming from pretty close to home.  But in the aquaculture world, there's primarily sugar kelp and there are two other types, but they're pretty minor.


        I know there's a lot of people working on it, but at the international level, you can pretty quickly discover that red seaweeds are where almost all the money is.  We've got to figure that out.  It's not as easy and there's a lot more scientific pieces to the puzzle.  And figuring out how to grow it and propagate it and put it out in the water – and it has a different time of year and lifecycle and a lot of other pieces.  But yeah, that's one of our ways of being resilient is to expand and to not think about – I don't really want to see 100-acre farms of sugar kelp out there.  I don't think that's going to behoove us.


Q: [1:06:47]        Do you see growing red seaweeds in Maine in the future?


A: [1:06:49]        Yeah, there's a bunch of projects happening.  I think it will happen.  Selfishly, in my lifetime, I would love to see an Atlantic-based seaweed sheet.  Doesn't have to be nori or its cousin, but I think we could get there.  And I think that for the most part, the country's ready for something like that – a domestic alternative to a sushi sheet.


Q: [1:07:14]        And are there any other changes that are impacting your work you want to tell us about?


A: [1:07:19]        Employment.  It is a humongous problem.  Right now, knock on wood, I have a pretty solid team.  I've had 10 core employees that have been here from before the pandemic.  I went through about a year and a half of every six months – you know, and it takes up a ton of bandwidth to hire, to train, to then have an exit interview, start all over again.  And there was more – like people just stopped showing up.  People got hired and never arrived for the job.  I don't even understand.  And then trying to keep up with wage demand and the double-edged sword of everybody who is working wants more money – OK, I get it, because everything at the grocery store and filling your car with gas, whatever it is, is costing more.  On the other side, because we sell into those same grocery stores, we're seeing sales slow down just a little bit.


        So trying to find that middle ground of keeping the employees, keeping them engaged, keeping them happy, not just raising prices to meet all the needs, because then we're just not selling as much product, which doesn't help the harvesters.  Like the whole cycle of it is challenging.  But the harvesters are just as challenged by getting the seasonal help that they need in order to get the product in the door from an employment standpoint, too.


        And then the expectations of what employees want or need from an employer versus what is actually possible, at least at our scale, is really challenging right now.  And it's tough.  I hoped that as an employee-ownership business that that would help us, but people have to be able to see a much bigger, longer-term – and I think the burnout post-pandemic is real.  I felt it, too.  I just am not in a position to walk off the job.  Yeah, I don't know what the answer is.  We've been making little shifts, and it's part of why I wanted to take this leadership course and learn from all these other industries and people, because I feel like the only thing I can control is how I respond to things coming at me.  And the best way to change how I respond is by learning from other people's experiences – stop living in my own lane and microcosm.


Q: [1:09:54]        Yeah, you had mentioned another business that you had a hand in.  Can you talk a little about that?


A: [1:09:59]        Yeah.  So in conjunction with a couple of friends, I've bought two pieces of commercial real estate here in downtown Ellsworth.  And we started an LLC and we're trying to be part of the solution in our older downtown infrastructure by creating good housing and having interesting businesses and not being part of the buy it up and put it on Airbnb only reality.  And, you know, we live in the gateway to Acadia.  We were all seeing that this is a hard challenge.


        You know, I appreciate this community, and having grown up here, left, and come back, I really love seeing how much it has evolved into a lot of good things.  So when an opportunity came up, it was one of those gifts where someone said, hey, this person really wants to sell their building, but they only want to sell it to people who live here who don't want to do X, Y, and Z.  There was no real estate agent involved.  Like it was one of those you're supposed to do this moments.  I didn't need another project. (laughter) But it's also been fun to have something that is not seaweed-related and really about community building and other things that I enjoy and have a different dynamic in my work world.


Q: [1:11:28]        Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes you've really experienced with seaweed?


A: [1:11:34]        Yeah, I mean, I was in middle school, freshman year of high school when my dad was doing recipe development for the cookbook we have.  And I did not like taking my lunches to school.  It was a traumatic experience at that age with those kids.  I went to my high school reunion and I had multiple people walk up and apologize to me and tell me how much their kids love seaweed and how much they realized that – you know, they were just being teenagers and going with the flow, but that we were ahead of the time.  I certainly knew at the time it was kind of traumatic for me, but I clearly moved on.  But it was also really amazing to realize – like that was a big deal they had the self-awareness to even state that.  But it also goes to the bigger piece of just recognizing that seaweed awareness is evolving.  And in my lifetime, you know, we have three Asian restaurants in downtown Ellsworth.  That's a very big deal comparative to growing up here.  It's baby steps.


Q: [1:12:52]        What is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's fisheries?


A: [1:12:57]        That we can look at the fisheries at a bigger, broader ecosystem and their interconnectedness.  I was talking with a research scientist recently.  We were discussing that if the DMR could create – there's an advisory council to the commissioner for every one of the fisheries.  It was a big deal that in the last 10 years, seaweed finally got its own advisory council of the DMR.  But her suggestion was that then there should be yet another one that has one member of all those fisheries that works together so that they're also all talking to each other and advising the commissioner at that level.  And her thinking is about this – like we need to be thinking more as an ecosystem.


        The last – no, two Sea Grant meetings ago, we were at the DMR, and we got given like maybe 10 five-minute mini-presentations of all the different things that they're doing, because they're growing and they just got a whole bunch of new money for a million things.  And that was great, but the whole time I was sitting there, I kept thinking, OK, lovely, you've got that reporting.  And great, you've got that new technology.  But nobody's talking about how you're over here with your scallop dragger, and there goes my kelp bed.  And you're over here – name all the ways in which they're harming each other and just listening to that.  I'm like, how can I be the only person thinking this?  I'm sure I was not the only person.  I was just not being vocal about it, and that wasn't appropriate in that moment.


        Collaboration really is what it boils down to – willingness to look beyond just the one fishery and to understand or regulate in a more holistic perspective of the way in which things are all interconnected and stop having it only be this is mine, and I'm the only thing that matters.  Because the fishermen, God bless them, that's mostly how they behave in whatever their sector is that they're doing in that moment.  You know, they might participate in five fisheries, but they're not all happening at the same time.  So as they move through them, that's the perspective they're taking.  It's a probably a pipe dream, but I can live in hope. (laughter) 


Q: [1:15:36]        I was going to ask – do you think that that's possible?


A: [1:15:40]        In my lifetime?  I don't know.  I think it might take a tragedy, unfortunately, and I'd hate to have that be the reason.  But yeah, we're not – yes, it is possible.  Do I think it's likely going to manifest?  No.  You know, there's a lot of things that are possible, but it's a little along the lines of our dependency on fossil fuel.  It's going to take something completely drastic and different, probably, to change the course of what's been happening for so long, and people's minds, and to understand the value of it.


Q: [1:16:22]        Have you noticed any changes in women's presence, participation, or status in fisheries over time?


A: [1:16:30]        I can't say I've been paying attention deeply until the last decade, but it does seem like there are more women involved.  If I just think about like assistant directors and executive directors I know in a lot of these environments and how many of them are women, I think that probably speaks to a version of what you're getting at, in that there is a change there.  If you've got leadership that's driven by that mentality, then maybe.


Q: [1:17:08]        Great.  And is there anything else you wanted to share with us?


A: [1:17:13]        Seaweed is not going to save the world.  However, it may still be part of our better solution.  But we're in this weird bubble right now, it seems like, where a lot of people are trying to put that kind of tag onto seaweed, that it is the solution for X, Y, and Z – which, as I stated before, I'm a little concerned could get ahead of us.


        But I don't want the other message to then be it's not a good, positive thing.  I think our bodies are better for it.  Our planet is potentially better for it.  If our plants are fed with it, then our plants have more nutrition and help us.  If we put it back in the soil, it's helping the planet from that perspective.  If we're feeding it to our animals, in spite of all this awful byproduct that many of them are fed, then their coats are happier, their brains are happier.  We're not getting a lot of the micronutrients that are in seaweed in most of our daily lives.  So I think we could potentially change people's relationship with food by just replacing a lot of table salt or using it as your preservative in bread as opposed to actual preservatives, and it will last longer.


        But here's the thing – Americans are obsessed with white, bleached.  If you do that to seaweed, you're removing a lot of the pieces that are going to solve that problem.  So we have this aesthetic part that is a massive holdup for something that in some ways seems so simple.  You don't need much seaweed to change your diet, actually.  You don't want to eat it in large volume, because most of us don't have the enzymes to process it, and it will make us feel kind of icky.  Or it's so high in iodine that it's actually not a good idea to eat a large volume of it, at least not on a daily basis.  So yeah, we kind of need to get over ourselves.


Q: [1:19:26]        Along those lines of – that seaweed's not going to save the world, I just wonder – you know, seaweeds are both impacted by climate change, but there's some buzz around, you know, they do sequester carbon, but some of these sort of investments in – looking at it as growing it to sequester carbon and sinking it.  And I know that there are sort of opponents and proponents of that and that it can be kind of controversial within the existing seaweed world in Maine.  So I don't know if you have any thoughts on sort of the function of seaweed and that sort of like climate mitigation sort of strategies.


A: [1:20:00]        Yeah, I think that's a way in which it's overhyped.  Dr. Nichole Price is somebody who I've come to really respect in that realm, and her take on it makes logical sense to me.  I don't have, again, all those acronyms after my name that she does.  But we don't know the damage we're doing by sinking to the bottom of the ocean.  We're back to this idea that you can put things in the ocean and you're not changing its ecosystem.  We don't know enough about what's under there.  Just because you can't see it doesn't mean you're not creating impact.  It seems ridiculous to me, quite frankly.  Can we sequester some amount of carbon by eating and evolving seaweed in other ways?  Sure.  But I don't think that sinking it is a solution.


Q: [1:20:55]        Great.  Hillary, do you have any other questions?


Q: [1:20:57]        No, that was my last one. 


Q: [1:21:00]        All right, great.  Then I will stop the recording.


END OF FILE"
"10","Q:        [0:00] If we could just start with how you like to introduce yourself.  


A:        [0:04] My name is Annie Fagan.  I'm a mariner, scientist, educator, and I work in marine extension for the Maine Sea Grant program.


Q:        [0:14] What year were you born?


A:        [0:16] 1993.


Q:        [0:17] Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:20] Yeah.  I grew up in Camden, Maine, Mid-Coast Maine.  That's where I grew up. (laughter)


Q:        [0:27] Where are your parents from?


A:        [0:29] My parents are originally from Connecticut and New Jersey.  They've been living in Maine most of their lives at this point in the mid-coast.


Q:        [0:41] What did they do either when you were growing up, now –


A:        [0:43] Yeah.  My parents met working for the Hurricane Island Outward Bound School, which is an outdoor education organization.  It used to be based on Hurricane Island in Penobscot Bay, and now they've got a base in Wheeler Bay.  At that time, they were both doing a lot of sailing, outdoor education, leading expeditions.  My dad went on to work as a boat captain for most of the rest of his career, captaining privately owned sailboats all over the place in the US and the Caribbean until about the last 10 years, and then he worked as an office administrator for a small consulting firm.  My mom took some time off to raise us and then has had a bunch of jobs since then, mostly in education, school administration, a little bit of healthcare administration – stuff like that.


Q:        [1:39] Great.  Thanks.  Did you grow up on the water?


A:        [1:42] Yeah.  Camden's on the water.  So, in that sense, I definitely did.  Had amazing access to the ocean and marine environments.  I spent some time in the summers when I was a young kid, learning how to sail at local day summer camps and stuff like that.  For a while, when I was younger, my dad worked for one particular family for quite a while, and they would usually invite the crew to bring their families on the boat maybe once or twice a summer.  


Q:        [2:14] Nice.  Do you have any siblings?  


A:        [2:16] Yeah.  I have a younger brother who lives in New Jersey and an older sister who lives in South Portland.


Q:        [2:20] Great.  Do you have any history of fishing in your family?


A:        [2:23] No, not really.  No commercial fishing in my family.


Q:        [2:28] What about recreational?


A:        [2:30] Probably.  My partner is a big fly-fishing person, but I would say not a huge, shared hobby in my family in general.


Q:        [2:38] Sure.  Do you have any family experience in other roles in the fishing industry?  That could be bookkeeping, processing, marketing, with bait or gear.


A:        [2:47] I don't think so, or not really, that I'm aware of.


Q:        [2:51] Cool.  Thank you.  Could you describe a little bit more what your dad's job was like when you were younger, captaining?  


A:        [2:57] Sure.  He worked as a boat captain for privately owned – I guess maybe the average person would say yachts – sailing boats.  The work really depended on the owner.  For example, he worked for 10 or 13 years for one single family when I was younger, and that particular family loved to cruise in Maine in the summers, so that's where most of the sailing would happen.  But they also would race.  So, my dad has done some pretty big sailboat races.  Other boats that he worked for just wanted the boat available to cruise for fun or with their family, or maybe they would want it to be in the Caribbean for the winter.  The work varied, but it was definitely a full-time-and-a-half-type job and sometimes involved him – almost always, he hired or had other crew that would work with him on the boat.  If he was racing or doing something like that, then he would be orchestrating that whole – the practices and the teams and that kind of thing.


Q:        [4:02] Cool.  Thank you.  Can you describe your educational background for me?


A:        [4:08] Sure.  I grew up in Camden, so I went through the public school system there, and then I went to Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.  I majored in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  Studied abroad a couple times, once for Italian and once for ecological field studies.  That's the end of my formal schooling to date.


Q:        [4:31] Great.  And are you married?


A:        [4:34] Yes.


Q:        [4:36] Do you have any children?


A:        [4:37] No children, just a four-legged one.


Q:        [4:41] Now, transitioning out of the more demographic questions to questions about your role or positionality, how would you describe your role or history in the fishing and aquaculture industry in Maine?


A:        [4:54] My role in those industries is all on the aquaculture side.  I worked in the industry a little bit, first at a raw bar shucking oysters.  I feel like that was kind of my first aquaculture job.  Then, I worked in research and development at a small oyster farm and hatchery on the Damariscotta River.  Now, I work for the Maine Sea Grant.  My work is in Aquaculture Extension, and that means a lot more statewide initiatives.  I do research, education, and outreach all around aquaculture, so that can really run the gamut.  Sometimes, it's technical assistance for farmers that are seeing something on their farm, wanting help, or just getting started.  We do a lot of training and workforce development, a lot of applied research, solving industry problems, and we also work with groups like municipalities, regulators, teachers, students, researchers.  If you're interested in aquaculture, we're interested in helping you.  Our tagline is marine science for Maine people.  We really are in service to the whole state of Maine, and those needs are ever-evolving and pretty dynamic.  


Q:        [6:11] Great.  I would love if you could take me through time a little bit and talk about how you got into working at the raw bar and how that led you to where you are now.  


A:        [6:20] Sure, it's kind of a long and winding story.  It's funny.  I grew up on the coast of Maine but never knew what aquaculture was until I was an adult.  I look back on that and find it really strange because it's everywhere.  I met my partner working for Outward Bound.  At the time, I was leading sailing expeditions, and she was running school bases in Maine and Florida, sometimes in the Bahamas.  We started to feel like we were ready to not live where we worked anymore and have a life on land or something closer to a nine-to-five.  We moved back to Maine.  We both are from here and have family here and landed in Portland, and honestly, just in looking for something to pay the bills, I found the job at the raw bar.  I was shucking full-time, and that was my first exposure to just an amazing sort of oyster culture that we have here in Maine.  I was interacting with a lot of product.  I was learning on the job about how to talk to customers about oysters and answer questions.  I was seeing the amazing variety and shape and color and different culture methods of all the different kinds of oysters that we have here.  


That sort of sparked an interest for me.  Some way or another, I learned about this program called Aquaculture in Shared Waters, which is a long-running training program offered by Maine Sea Grant and several other organizations that all partner together, and it's designed to help people start an aquaculture business.  I was hearing all about oysters, and my partner and I were at a transition point in our lives.  We both have marine backgrounds.  I have a science background, so we thought maybe we could take this class and maybe start an oyster farm.  It was great.  We loved the course.  We got pretty fired up to the point where we were thinking about siting and where we might have a farm and thinking about what that lifestyle would look like.  Then COVID happened.  


So, that threw a wrench in all of our plans, but definitely for us, we were thinking, OK, probably not the best time to start a business and do something that we have never done before or invest a lot of money into something that feels pretty risky.  But I had caught the bug, so I started thinking about how I could learn more about the industry without having to put a lot of money up of my own and figured I should just get someone else to pay me to learn more about it.  That was how I ended up banging down the doors of a bunch of different farms, and it ended up being a really good match for me and Mook Sea Farm.  They were looking to ramp up their research and development capabilities, so I started out in that role with them and ended up also doing a lot on the production side, helping to raise oyster microalgae and run experiments in the hatchery.  From there, it was a hop, skip, and jump to the job that I'm in now.  That’s been my trajectory, and that story I just told is all compressed into the last four or five years.  So, a new chapter in my career for me.


Q:        [9:47] Sure.  So, how long – go ahead.


F:        [9:48] I think maybe the same question – I was just thinking – what year did you start working at the raw bar since that feels like the beginning of your –?


A:        [9:55] OK.  That was pre-COVID.  I'm resisting the urge to get out my camera roll in my phone because that's often how I remember years and dates.  I would say that was probably 2019.  I think we took Shared Waters that winter of 2019 into 2020.  I was working at the raw bar at that time, I think, and we moved here to this peninsula where I'm sitting now in 2021.  I think that's probably when I started working at the hatchery.  I started in this role with Maine Sea Grant last January of 2023.


Q:        [10:39] Great.  Thank you so much.  I'm going to get back into the Sea Grant stuff, but can you describe just a little bit more what it was like to work in all those different facets of the farm?


A:        [10:51] At Mook?


Q:        [10:52] Yes.


A:        [10:53] Yeah, sure.  Mook is a really unique company, and this is part of the reason I wanted to work there because they have a farm.  They're raising oysters and selling them.  They also have a hatchery, which is pretty unusual.  There's only a few commercial hatcheries in the state of Maine, and they're supplying oyster seed to farmers, not just in Maine but all up and down the East Coast.  So, that was pretty unique to me.  Also, every hatchery grows microalgae because that's what you need to feed the baby oysters, but Mook Sea Farm has some really interesting proprietary technology that allows them to produce a lot of microalgae in a small space.  They just have a lot of different things going on inside one company.  That’s part of why I thought it would be a good place for me to learn, and it definitely was.  


The work started out mostly, like I said, in research and development.  We would do experiments about all kinds of things, any pressing problems that were coming up across the company, so not just in the hatchery, but maybe in the packing plant or on the farm.  It was really rewarding because sometimes we might have someone come up with a problem or pitch an idea for some small-scale experiment that we might do.  Maybe we're doing it two weeks later.  We finish a few weeks from then, and there's kind of an instant applied change that you could be making in a process somewhere in the company.  That was really cool to be a part of, and it felt really different from doing research in an academic setting, where you might be proposing something and then doing the work a year later, and then the work takes a couple years, and then no one's going to hear about it for a couple more years, because that's just like how the machine churns.  Being in that applied, rapid environment was really cool.  


Then, when I started getting pulled more into the production work that winter, that was just such a deep dive in how to grow microalgae, how to raise baby oysters, all the science and monitoring and husbandry that goes into that – that was all new for me.  Sometimes, depending on the experiments we were doing, I might have gotten out onto the river, but for the most part, my time was in the hatchery indoors, either working in production or research.


Q:        [13:16] Great.  Thank you so much.  I'm curious.  Do you or did you ever hold any commercial fishing licenses?


A:        [13:24] No, I haven't.


Q:        [13:27] I feel like this question is going to take us through a lot of things.  I'm going to ask it as it's written and then figure out what the best way to answer is.  The question is, do you have any experience in the industry beyond directly fishing or harvesting, which you've described a little, but I'm going to give you some prompts that might help think about that.


A:        [13:46] Sure.  


Q:        [13:47] Do you have any experience in bookkeeping, bait, or gear preparation?


A:        [13:52] No.


Q:        [13:54] What about post-harvest processing, marketing, or trade?


A:        [14:03] I'm only taking this long pause because I'm thinking about it.  No.  Some of the work we do at Sea Grant might go into those arenas.  I have colleagues who do projects in those areas, but so far, my work hasn't really taken me to that place.  Maybe, with the exception of post-harvest, is a good example.  Sometimes, we might get growers asking us, “What's the best way to bring my product down to temperature, or what are the recommended handling practices for XYZ?”  We touch some of those areas, but I haven't had as much experience there.  


Q:        [14:43] Cool.  I think this last one might be a good segue into what your work with Sea Grant looks like.  Do you have any experience in advocacy or community-based organizations related to fisheries or aquaculture?


A:        [14:56] That's a good question.  I would say that I don't personally.  Sea Grant is a non-advocacy organization, so that's not the one thing we can't do.  But because we get funding from Congress and through NOAA, we don't take a stand on any policy or legislative issues.  We're very much in the neutral advisor role.  That's me myself, but we certainly partner with organizations that might do advocacy or community organizing around fisheries or aquaculture, and sometimes that can be a really good match because they were able to do things that we don't do, and vice versa, but we don't end up in that role.  


Q:        [15:43] Sure.  


F:        [15:44] I'm thinking that your role makes me think of several gaps we actually have in that question because you've already said, I think, quite a few really interesting ways in which you're involved, which makes me think our categories are limiting, which is extension, which is different, as you point out, from advocacy.


A:        [16:00] It's a weird animal, yeah.  


F:        [16:01] You talked about food preparation and interfacing between the product and the consumer.


A:        [16:07] Right.


F:        [16:08] And research and development as well as the input side on hatchery seed rearing.  It seems like you have a lot of interesting ones, which are actually ones that we just haven't asked as specific subcategories.  So, helping us see our own gaps. (laughter)


A:        [16:23] Yeah, sure.  I think a lot of these topics are things that me or colleagues might provide advising or training on, even if it's by connecting somebody to somebody that knows the answer to their question.  We do that kind of thing all the time.  Anyway, glad to help the questions.


Q:        [16:42] Yeah.  I was going to say that transitions us into now.  I'm curious.  What does your work with Sea Grant look like?  How would you describe your role?


A:        [16:52] Sure.  I'm getting better at doing this, but it's such a funny animal because the work is really dynamic.  It changes all the time, and we try to be responsive to the needs that we're hearing about from the people that we work with and the people that we serve.  But right now, my work is pretty varied.  I was hired to coordinate the Maine Aquaculture Hub, which is a funded project that existed before me, is now in its second round of funding, and it's meant to be a network that brings people together across the state.  There's a steering committee of a bunch of different organizations that coordinate the hub along with me.  


The project work includes things like an economic impact assessment of the aquaculture sector, so looking at trying to get some data and numbers for how those impacts shake out across the state.  We are developing online curriculum training modules about aquaculture.  There's been a lot of public outreach and engagement funded as a part of this project.  So I'm running a cooking demo series this summer, highlighting – actually, we're going to highlight both farmed and wild products and hope to draw some guests to break down some of the mystery of preparing seafood and make it more approachable and show people how it can be eaten at home.  


Then, we also funded – as a new iteration and curriculum for the aquaculture and Shared Waters program, which is the same class I took years ago, we offered this winter a series of workshops for women and non-binary folks in the industry here in Maine.  That was a new offering for us and a part of the project that I've had my hands in quite a bit, and I'm really proud of.  That’s all to say that's the project I manage now.  That’s most of my work.  


Then, in addition, stuff comes up.  People reach out with questions.  There's ongoing research needs that I get pulled into.  I end up talking a lot with people who are interested in careers in aquaculture or wanting to start a business.  Sea Grant tends to be a first point of contact for a lot of those types of questions.  Then, I have an education background, so I love teaching.  That's part of what makes things like Shared Waters so fun and enjoyable for me, and I end up doing, when I have the chance, education programs with local schools or teachers that are looking to connect their students to these types of topics.  So, all kinds of stuff, really.


Q:        [19:38] Great.  Yeah, I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about the most recent iteration of Shared Waters and what your experience was like with that.


A:        [19:54] Sure.  The idea for a more targeted curriculum of Shared Waters has been brewing for a few years, pre-me at Sea Grant, and coming in the form of folks suggesting or requesting, “Hey, what would it look like if we had a training that was just for women or just for people of color or just for an underrepresented group in the industry?”  So, through the hub, this second round of funding, we proposed a needs assessment to more formally gather information and data that would build on those anecdotal requests that the program has been getting.  So, I worked with a graduate student at the University of Maine and another colleague last fall.  We did a little over 30 interviews with women who had been through the Shared Waters program before in its other iterations and asked them a lot of questions to get a sense of – what was your experience like in that course?  In that program?  What did you like about it?  What did you not like about it?  What have your experiences been like in aquaculture since then?  


People go on from the course to do all kinds of stuff.  So, sometimes they end up in aquaculture, and sometimes they end up somewhere else.  With both of those, in the course and after, trying to get a sense of how much gender has played a role in their experiences as they perceived that.  Then we also ask some questions about – what would you want it to look like if we were to offer a targeted program that would be for women or nonbinary folks?  Is that something that would be valuable to you or not?  Would you be interested in it?  And if you are, what would you want it to look like?  And what kind of curriculum would you want to see covered?  Basically, what have been the gaps in your learning experience or information that you feel like you had a harder time accessing?  


That was such a great, really interesting process.  We learned a ton.  You can imagine that the answers run the gamut because women aren't a monolith, so everybody had different opinions, and it was really interesting to hear about those.  Based on the feedback that we received, we felt like there was a significant need and interest in a targeted program.  So, we designed a curriculum based on the topics that women had told us they would really want to learn about.  It turned out that there was almost no overlap with the curriculum that we had already been offering.  


I'll give a couple of examples of topics that we covered in the workshops, some of which are useful for everybody.  So, we’re like, “Maybe we should add those back into what we already do because they're so important.”  We heard women talking a lot about having a harder time accessing technical skills, especially in the maritime field.  So, things like navigation.  Trailering was a classic example of something that – what we heard from folks is that that can also have a gendered component.  Just to take that example a little further, most small farmers in Maine, a lot of them are launching boats from public access points.  A lot of harvesters, too.  


We heard from plenty of women who learned how to trailer in public parking lots, and that can be really challenging because there's people around, and everybody has an opinion, and they express that they would love to be able to learn and develop those skills in kind of an open, non-judgmental, starting from the basics and moving all the way up space.  I think a lot of people can relate to – anyone who's ever backed a trailer up in a public place, you probably had someone else telling you how to do it better.  That was one piece.  


We heard a lot of interest in women who were saying, “I love this work, and I want to do it for a long time, and I want to also take care of my body while I'm doing it.”  Aquaculture is super physical.  It's really manual, and the work can be brutal.  A lot of the gear – gear you wear, or gear that you're using to hold your animals, or whatever it is – is designed for people that are ultra-strong and have really big bodies and hands.  We heard from women that they wanted to learn some tools to be able to use that gear better, to have less pain on the job, to reduce the risk of injury.  They were interested in learning from each other, too, about how to move through those challenges ergonomically on the farm.  


Some other topics we covered – some business topics.  Being a woman in the business landscape can be really different.  We got some great expertise there.  We did a workshop around kind of communications and storytelling and showing up in the online space as a woman or non-binary person.  We did a workshop on social license.  That was the one piece of overlap.  We always talk about social license in aquaculture and Shared Waters.  Social license is the idea of cultivating trust in your business and your community.  There are lots of ways to go about that, and it's a really important part of the process here in Maine.  Some women experience that as different because of their gender.  The way we move around socially in the world can be impacted by that.  It was really neat to do that workshop with that lens added to it.  


Another thing we heard a lot about in the interviews was interest in the curriculum, for sure, but also just wanting to network and connect and build relationships with other women in the field, and so we built into each workshop get-to-know-you time or structured networking activities.  We always had time afterward for people to just connect and get together.  I know from my experience in the course – or a slightly different course years ago – that having that person-to-person contact with the instructors and other students in the course, some of whom were already farming, was really important in helping it stick for me and helping me feel like I might have a place in the industry.  


It was really rewarding, I think, to be able to provide that to other people.  We have plans to keep expanding that network part as well.  That was a little bit about the workshops.  One really cool thing about it was that we decided that we wanted the instructors to be women as well, just to close that loop.  In affinity training, that's kind of a best practice as well.  That pushed us to form some new partnerships and bring instructors into the program who hadn't participated before, some of whom aren't super active in the aquaculture space, and some of whom are.  There was some really cool cross pollination that happened there, and that felt really good to broaden that circle.


Q:        [27:01] Cool.  I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about – what are your reflections now that that's happened on it and looking towards the future?


A:        [27:11] Yeah, so many.  We just had our last workshop a couple days ago, so I know I'm going to be thinking about it a lot.  Well, we had a ton of interest in the program.  I guess that's where I would start.  We had almost two people apply for every spot, and so that was very exciting to know that we were offering something that there was interest and demand.  It was also crushing to not be able to wrap in all those people for this very first year.  But it does make us feel like we need to find a way to keep doing this.  We've applied for funding in a couple different places to be able to offer something like this again.  That’s my first takeaway, is this is valuable, and there is interest in it.  


So, that's one of my takeaways.  I think one of the coolest parts for me was just – and this happens in general when you get folks in aquaculture and Maine together, especially people who are coming from – we had pretty varied geographical representation.  We had some folks who have been farming for a long time, and some folks who are employees on other people's farms, some people who are new.  We kind of intentionally engineered the cohort to have that diversity in it because we wanted people to benefit from that range of experience.  There was just so much co-teaching and collaboration that happened, which was really cool.  We asked participants if – we let them know what the workshops were going to be, and said, “Hey, do you have expertise that you would want to share as part of any of these topics?”  A bunch of people leaned into that opportunity.  It was really cool to be able to set that up and give people opportunities to share their knowledge with one another.  The aquaculture community in Maine tends to be a really collaborative and inclusive place, and we see a ton of that farmer-to-farmer teaching.  That was a huge highlight for me.  


It was unique to be in a space where gender was pre-determined to be an open part of the conversation, and it felt great.  We set working agreements as a group to talk about how we would treat one another, how we wanted to work together, and how we wanted to show up.  There was a ton of compassion, humility, and understanding that came out in those agreements, and also just in the way that people supported each other during the workshops and learned together.  Certainly, you can have that environment in any group, but it was just a huge defining vibe of the course in general that felt really special to me.  


Already, it's inspired us to think about how we keep this momentum going and how we keep building strength and connections for this group of people.  Maine is ahead of the curve in some ways when it comes to women in aquaculture.  We took our work from that needs assessment that I mentioned to a conference in Florida called Women of Water that was offered for women in aquaculture all across the country.  When we shared about the research, we got a lot of reactions, like, “I wish this was happening in my state.”  “I'm the only female oyster grower that I know.”  “How do we get something like this where I am?”  I'm sure we're not the first people to think about doing something like this in particular, but we're hopeful that this program could be a model for other places or other states.  This is certainly not the only underrepresented group in the aquaculture space that deserves more attention and more equity when it comes to training opportunities.  It’s a first drop in the bucket but feels like a good drop.


Q:        [31:20] Cool.  This is an interesting shift, and I think a difficult question to answer, but I'm curious if you could describe what an average day looks like for you.  You've described a lot of different responsibilities, so I guess I'm wondering how does that look in a day.  


A:        [31:35] Sure.  It's so funny because it does really change.  I can give an example on both ends of the spectrum.  Sometimes, some part of my job is a lot of maybe coordinating over email, tracking budgets, sitting at a desk, working on my computer, maybe having meetings with farmers or other team members.  At the way, other far end of the spectrum would be – a couple weeks ago, I had the wildest day in the life.  It was during seaweed week.  It's actually more than a week, but it's about a week and a half festival that my colleague Jaclyn Robidoux of Maine Sea Grant and Heritage Seaweed, which is a shop in Portland – they sort of co-host, and there's lots of pop-up events, restaurants putting on special dishes all over the state, and the intent is to kind of highlight the wild seaweed harvest and the farm seaweed sector in Maine.  


So, as part of that, I put on an event in Stonington.  We put together a panel of folks to share about what's happening in aquaculture all across the state.  I partnered with Linda Nelson, who's the Economic and Community Development Director for the town of Stonington, to add this event to their civic conversation series around their economic resiliency strategy in their town.  This particular day, I was driving across the state to our office in Orono, picking up a bunch of materials that we wanted to share for the event, driving to Stonington, which is amazing, beautiful place, totally different from the slice of the world that I live in, setting up for this event, hosting this panel, meeting lots of local residents, answering questions, seeing this really cool community conversation happen around aquaculture, spending the night, and then the next morning, got to jump on a boat with Abby Barrows, who had been a part of the panel the night before.  Jaclyn and I got to help her with their kelp harvest.  That would be a wild day in the life, out in the field, public engagement, or being on farms, and it can be anywhere in between.


Q:        [33:51] Great.  Thanks.  How do you feel that your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing sector – fishing and aquaculture – including how others perceive or treat you?


A:        [34:05] That's a good question.  I guess on the background piece – it's funny.  I look back on the last maybe four or five jobs I've had, and at the time, I was just choosing the next thing that seemed interesting or useful.  Now, in this role, I draw on a lot of those experiences that, at the time, didn't seem connected, like the raw bar, jobs I've had in research, working on an oyster farm.  I think having that applied and industry background is really useful for me in this role.  It's small in comparison to a lot of the farmers that I work with, but having that grounding in what it means to work in aquaculture, what are the best parts of that, what are the challenges that come with that is really useful to me, and is part of why I took this job because I saw it as an opportunity, at a state level and beyond, to support people in some of the problems that I found maybe challenging or difficult when I was doing that work.  I think I bring that.  


Then, other parts of my background in terms of skills would be education.  I love teaching.  This is a field where that's a huge asset to be able to – whether it's working with a sea farmer to teach them better ways to do what they're doing out on the farm or train them up if they're new, or even just explaining and sharing about aquaculture to the general public or a group of young students because ideas (inaudible) culture tends to be a pretty mysterious and confusing thing to people who haven't been exposed to it, and the average person has no way to go see it or understand visually what's happening.  That part of my background serves me well.  


Then, as far as my identity, I hold some that are underrepresented in aquaculture.  I think being a woman, being queer, being disabled, those are all things that I know whenever I meet people who share those identities, it's exciting, and it's nice to know that that community is building, and I think holding those parts of myself is also part of what motivates me to make sure that I'm finding opportunities to help open doors or make aquaculture more inclusive for other people.  That definitely is part of what shapes my work, and when I think about the type of work I want to be doing, I don't imagine ever putting that thread down.


Q:        [36:49] Great.  Thanks.  How do you feel your role interacts with any present or future family or caregiving responsibilities?


A:        [37:02] That's a good question.  I don't have any children and don't plan to.  I did find when I was working in the industry that the hours are long and the work is intense, and so part of me transitioning into this role was looking for a bit more of a balance that worked better for me and my partner and being able to spend more time with my family and things like that.  So, in that sense, it feels like a really good fit.  And for me, where I'm at right now, early career, I have that freedom and flexibility to work long days, to be traveling for a conference, or to be overnight somewhere.  For me right now, it's a good fit with the responsibilities that I have.


Q:        [37:59] Great.  Now, we're going to transition into some questions about environmental change.  Feel free to answer those from your perspective, or if from your role, you have a culmination of perspectives you'd like to share, whatever feels right for the question.  Can you describe any changes in the marine environment that you've noticed or have heard a lot about?


A:        [38:21] Sure.  Man, it's hard to know where to start because there are so many, but a few examples that come to mind are climate change.  The ocean is getting warmer.  We all know that.  The Gulf of Maine is warming more rapidly than most other bodies of water in the world, so we're kind of on the front lines here in terms of water getting warmer.  For me, that doesn't necessarily have as direct of a personal impact.  I'm not harvesting a resource or cultivating one, but for the farmers that I serve, it definitely plays out, sometimes in positive ways.  It might make certain parts of Maine better for growing oysters, which grow faster when the water is warmer.  So, that's an aspect of it.  


It also brings a lot of other issues, ocean acidification being one.  That's something that has a huge impact, especially on shellfish.  It makes it harder for them to build their shells.  The hatchery that I worked at when I was in the industry has – that affects the work that they do as well, and they've had to make some modifications to how they raise their oysters, especially their baby oysters, to deal with that.  Something else that's like hard to miss if you're living on the coast of Maine is just new species coming in.  Green crabs would be one great example.  We see so many more of them than we used to, and that affects a lot of the shellfish harvesters that we work with.  


Even just thinking about when I was a kid, bumming around on islands or out in boats with friends or my dad, you used to see lots more blue mussels than we do now.  I think species change is a big one, and that translates onto the farm as well.  For example, biofouling is a big issue on seed farms.  That's something everybody has to manage.  Whenever you put something in the water, stuff wants to grow on it – tunicate, sea squirts, marine algae, all kinds of things.  That tends to usually be detrimental to whatever you're growing.  It might choke off water flow or make it harder for those oysters or shellfish or whatever organism it is to get food out of the water.  So, farmers spend a lot of time and energy managing that biofouling.  What we hear is that the composition of the animals that they're seeing is also changing, so that means they constantly need to be adapting to that.  


Similarly, for animals that have a planktonic larval form and then settle – that's what we call it, when a shellfish turns from maybe a swimming baby oyster into an oyster that's now no longer moving in its adult form.  A lot of that settlement has changed, and probably a good example would be blue mussels.  This plays out in a couple ways.  One is that blue mussel farmers – most of them – use wild seed to start their crop.  So, they're putting out ropes or other rough materials and waiting for blue mussels to settle or land and attach on those ropes.  The timing of that settlement has also changed, and the availability of that spat or those baby mussels.  There are farms in Maine now that have – I know of at least one farm that has actually gone straight – they've moved all together to purchasing baby mussels from a hatchery because they needed a reliable seed source, and they couldn't get it anymore where they lived.  


We work with another farm that's trying to develop ways where they can grow out their own baby seed indoors and then plant it out on their farm.  For farmers who aren't raising mussels but maybe are raising oysters in cages where baby mussels end up attaching to those cages, which is a huge nuisance if you're not trying to grow baby mussels, the timing of that settlement is also changing.  Farmers that are used to maybe raising their cages out of the water at a certain time to avoid that settlement are now having to, every year, be observant and do the best that they can to mitigate that, in that context, what's a nuisance/pest.  So, those are a few changes that come to mind and really just scratching the surface.


Q:        [43:18] Yeah.  You've mentioned a few different effects of those, but I'm curious if there are any other ways that you really want to highlight.  That series of changes, I know, like climate change, biofouling, these differences in settlement, how else is that really impacting the work?


A:        [43:32] I would say it's – I don't know.  The impact is that some of the farming techniques that people use, or the environments that they're used to working in, or the local knowledge that they have from being in a place for a long time, some of those don't apply anymore, or aren't useful in the same way that used to be or need to be changed.  We are an organization that often gets called on to address things like that, and so we end up working hand in hand with folks often to try to solve those problems.  I guess I would say that it has created a lot of new opportunities for research and adaptation that maybe wouldn't be there otherwise.  In some cases, they really are opportunities.  There are things that are now possible that weren't before.  


I guess the other thing I would say is that because of all the downstream effects, climate change being one example, I think it has a couple things.  One, I hear that often as a motivator from a lot of the sea farmers that we work with.  Everybody wants to do something to make the planet a little bit better.  Aquaculture can be a tool not only to provide a really sustainable protein that doesn't require a lot of inputs or fresh water or things that you might need to farm on land but also is very often improving the health and the quality of the environment that you're raising it in.  When I ask sea farmers why they're doing what they're doing, usually one of the first three things they'll say is because they want to do their part to – we're not going to turn back the clock on climate change by doing it, but it can, on a small, micro scale or a local scale, mitigate some of those impacts.  That impacts my work, too, because it's a driving motivation for what might be getting people into it.  


The other thing I would say is that because some of the downstream effects of climate change have impacted other fisheries, too, some folks are looking to aquaculture as a way to keep working on the water and have a bit more control over the resource that they're managing.  It’s another tool in their toolbox to maybe diversify the income that they bring home from fishing.  It's not a transition that works for everybody.  Fishing and farming are really different.  It’s definitely not a magic bullet.  But when you look at the people that are farming along the coast of Maine, we work with plenty of folks who have either transitioned into aquaculture or are adding it to the fisheries that they already practice.


Q:        [46:47] Could you tell me about things that you've seen as responses, adaptations, ways that people have coped with these changes they're seeing?  


A:        [46:55] Yeah, I can, and there's so many, but I'll try to give a few examples.  Speaking about Mook Sea Farm, where I worked – so, I was mentioning ocean acidification, and that's something they keep really close tabs on.  The water that they use for their hatchery indoor seawater systems comes straight from the Damariscotta River.  They noticed several years ago – this was before me–  that the pH of the incoming water was getting to be pretty different from what it had used to be, and it was affecting the health of the larvae and the baby oysters that they were raising.  They started – and since then, other hatcheries – this is now standard practice – buffering the water in those tanks, so adding a food-safe compound just to keep the pH at a place where it's best for oysters to grow.  Like I said, now that's pretty standard.  That was a change that they felt like they had to make in order to keep doing what they were doing.  


Other changes?  I mean, it really varies, and some of them are playing out as we speak.  I didn't mention this before, but I think increased storm and precipitation is another change that we've seen play out on the coast of Maine and in many other places, and that has an impact on shellfish farmers, particularly because when there's a lot of freshwater input into a salty body of water over a small amount of time, it can be a better place for things like vibrio to grow, which is a bacteria that's harmful to humans when we eat it in too high of a concentration.  So, if there's a lot of rain in a growing area in a small amount of time, the regulators will close that area to harvest.  


Last summer, as an example, it rained almost all summer, all the time.  There was a lot more closures than there have been in the past.  For the average small farmer, there's not that much you can do about that.  Most small shellfish farmers in Maine probably don't have a place where they can hold oysters or be buffered from that kind of change.  We do hear about farmers who – I mean, farmers are always looking at the weather.  They've been doing that for forever, but they might be planning a harvest at a different time than they would usually do it because they know there's a rainstorm coming or something like that.  


Again, using Mook as an example, they have built, I think, in the last 10 years, maybe in the last 15 years, a recirculating aquaculture facility so that they have the ability to hold oysters indoors for weeks at a time, and that allows them to “harvest.”  I’m putting harvest in quotes because they're doing it from inside their building even if there is a rainfall closure because they have the ability to just shut off the exchange water, so the water that would be coming in from the river, and instead just recirculate the water that's in there already.  That protects the oysters from any of those harmful bacteria that there might be more of in the water, and they can still make sales.  


That's a good example because I think it shows there's a varying ability of individual farmers or farms to respond to those changes.  But storms is another one.  I think we're going to see more and more storms on the coast of Maine.  I mean, just this past winter, we had some really devastating storms.  I think the devastation was more felt on the wild fisheries side.  A lot of people lost access to maybe piers or wharves that were destroyed that they used to launch boats.  Most of the farmers that we work with did OK.  A lot of folks here in Maine sink their farms to the bottom in the winter, and that can help insulate from some of those storms if they're happening during that time.  


I'm learning a lot from our Sea Grant colleagues in other states, especially on the Gulf Coast, where hurricanes are a thing.  That's an example of something – when I think about us having more intense storms in the future, I think we're going to have a lot to learn on the aquaculture side about how to prepare for those and how to respond to them from our colleagues and our networks in places that are used to dealing with those much more intense storms.  So, those are a couple of examples that come to mind.  


Q:        [51:44] Sure.  Have you seen any attempts to adapt or cope with the biofouling or the green crabs?


A:        [51:52] Yeah, green crabs, that's a good example.  There are some really bright, creative, determined minds in that space.  Some examples of work we see around green crabs – and a lot of this I know about through our colleague, Gabby Bradt, who works at New Hampshire Sea Grant.  She does a ton of outreach and research around green crabs.  There's a lot of people focused on figuring out how we can monetize that resource because that is a great way of getting something out of the ocean.  If it's worth money, then that helps people be able to do that better.  Everything from processing those crabs into other things like fish sauce.  


New Hampshire Sea Grant worked on a project where one of the outputs was whiskey that had green crab-something-or-other in it.  There's a lot of creativity in that space.  I don't think we've necessarily cracked the code, but there are some startup companies here in Maine that are working on stuff like that.  Could we crush them up and put them in fertilizer?  It’s not a crab that people necessarily – that some people want to eat as it is, and there tends to be less meat in a single green crab than a crab from Chesapeake Bay of a different species.  That’s part of the challenge there.  


Recently, I've heard from colleagues in Maine – I think this would be a really exciting area.  There are plenty of folks, actually, that are interested in eating crabs that way.  For example, the Cambodian community in Maine – that's very similar to some foods that they are used to eating.  Part of it is reframing the question of where are the markets for these items or these fisheries that are kind of emerging, and how do we tap into those?  In that case, it would be a great fit of providing a really culturally appropriate and valued food source to people who are accustomed to preparing it and cooking it and love to eat it.  Yeah.  Those are a few examples around green crabs.  I forgot the rest of your question.


Q:        [54:04] Or biofouling?  Any other adaptations you might be seeing?  


A:        [54:13] This is an informal adaptation, but farmers talk to each other a lot, so when people are seeing biofouling organisms that they don't recognize, or they're seeing them at a different time, they're going to be reaching out to their neighbors that are farming in the same area.  “Hey, have you seen this?”  Or they're going to be calling us or other – “Who's seen this before?  Who knows it?  What's the best way to get it off my stuff?”  A lot of that kind of farmer-to-farmer teaching that I was talking about.  


We were also talking earlier about changes in times of settlement.  I'll give an example of a project we haven't funded yet, but we'd love to, is looking at new technology that might help us better be able to understand the phonology and the timing and the abundance of those settling organisms.  Looking at the blue mussel as an example, larval shellfish are really hard to tell apart.  If I was looking at a mussel or an oyster or a scallop under a microscope, when they're in that early stage, they all look almost exactly the same.  But there's some new technology we'd love to get our hands on called a bivalve larval imaging sensor, and that would allow us to take a water sample, take all the shellfish larvae that are in there, and the machine, once you train it with a set of images, it can speciate and count, so identify by species and count all the shellfish larvae that are in there.  Very cool.  We would love to get our hands on one of those.  


That would be an example of a tool that would allow us to, more accurately and probably more rapidly, take a water sample from someone's farm site and say, “No blue mussels there.”  Two weeks later, now we're starting to see a lot more of them.  This is probably the time that they're going to settle.  You should think about flipping your cages or keeping them out of the water longer or something like that.  This is us looking ahead into the future a little bit and thinking about what are other tools that might be available now that weren't before that can help us get better information about the changes in the timing of what we're seeing.


Q:        [56:27] Cool.  You've listed so many different adaptations which are so useful for us.  I'm curious if you feel like those are really helping.


A:        [56:37] Yeah, that's a good question.  I hope so. (laughter) I think so.  I primarily work with sea farmers in Maine, and the best resource that we have often is like the brains of all the farmers.  People here have been farming for decades.  We have a lot of experience, best practices, and knowledge that gets passed on in the industry, and we also have a lot of new entrants.  That combination of experience and fresh perspectives makes a really fertile proving ground for resilience and creativity and new adaptations that come up, and they get shared out pretty rapidly.  Some of the examples we've talked about today, 10 years ago, were a new standard thing that somebody was trying and now have become best practice across the board.  I think that some of them are definitely working, and also, sometimes it feels like you're constantly just trying to catch up to the newest change or the newest trend or the newest problem.  So, it's a yes-and.


F:        [58:04] You talked about quite a few different impacts that I think from what I captured mostly was about impacts on oyster or mussel farmers.  I wonder if you have any observations about environmental changes and impacts on seaweed farms.  I think that is probably most of the small farms, but I don't know if they're any scallop farms.  


A:        [58:21] There are scallop farms in Maine.


F:        [58:24] I know there’s a couple less common – but yeah, just wondering if you have any observations through your work about those environmental changes and their impacts on some of those other species that are farmed.


A:        [58:32] Yeah, there are a bunch of species I haven't talked about today that we're farming in Maine.  We have the only eel-raising facility in the country.  We do have people here farming scallops.  That part of the shellfish sector is relatively new.  There might be maybe four or five scallop farms in the state.  That's a good example of a type of farming that's very much – we’re still figuring out the best way to do it, and we've learned a lot from Japan and other countries and places where they do that really well.  Seaweed, for sure.  That's another great example.  I was talking earlier about crops that are good for the ocean, and seaweed is a great example of that.  They sequester carbon and other compounds.  They can pull nutrients out of the water.  There are places where people are planting kelp not to eat it or to harvest it but just to remediate pollution or shore runoff or things like that.  


In terms of adaptation, it's a little harder to say because – it's funny.  Maine leads the US in terms of landings of farmed kelp.  We are knocking it out of the park in comparison to other states, and still, that industry is less than ten years old.  It’s been a huge, huge effort across the board by a lot of folks.  Kelp is a good example of one that a lot of kelp farmers are fishermen.  Kelp farming happens in the winter, which is a season that, for a lot of fishermen in Maine, they're not bringing home as much, or maybe they're not out on the water as much.  Kelp, in comparison to something like oysters, is pretty simple.  You seed it.  You leave it be.  It doesn't need anything from you other than tending your lines, making sure it doesn't get tangled or fouled up, and then you come back and harvest it, and that's it.  


One thing I think about when I think about kelp is it's a cold-water species.  That's why we grow it in the winter and every year, at harvest season, which tends to be late April/early May – harvest season just wrapped up last week in Maine.  It's always you want it to grow as long as possible, but once the water starts reaching a certain temperature, stuff is going to biofoul your crops.  So, things are going to settle on there – algae, snails, things that nobody wants to eat.  When I look ahead 10, 20 years from now, I imagine we're going to see that harvest season probably move earlier in the year as temperatures get warmer.  That's something that farmers are going to be thinking about and planning for.  Maybe the solution is just to plant a little bit earlier.  Maybe it's going to drive changes in farm structure so people can put more yield on the same amount of space, things like that.


Q:        [1:01:51] I'm curious, with all of these different adaptations, what do you think has made it possible for farmers to make them – you mentioned relationships, but some other words we have that you could draw on – resources, knowledge, training, organizations, Sea Grant probably.


A:        [1:02:06] Yeah.  Sea Grant is just one example of – we have an incredible network of support organizations and individuals, I would say, in the marine space, in general in Maine, but certainly in aquaculture and fisheries.  A colleague of mine recently shared with me an infographic of kind of all the different organizations of support and the niches they fill, and it’s mind-boggling.  It's amazing to be a part of that.  So, Sea Grant is one example.  We work really closely with groups like the Maine Aquaculture Association.  That’s a trade association that represents sea farmers.  The Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center.  They do research, a lot of education, and workforce development around aquaculture.  We have the Aquaculture Research Institute at the University of Maine and a lot of faculty and students that are studying aquaculture or doing applied research.  So, those are all examples.  


Then, on the business side, we have a really, really robust small business, startup entrepreneurship support system in Maine, which is also really important.  Ultimately, sea farming is a business.  People are trying to make a living, and having support on the financial side is going to make for a more resilient business network when these challenges do come up.  Farmers are better prepared to absorb a loss or damage from a storm, a reduction in their harvest or their yield for that season, unexpected mortality, or any of those kinds of things that come along.  That's sort of the nature of farming or getting your living from a wild resource.  They're better able to handle all those things when they have a stronger financial standing.  So, we have a lot of organizations in the state that really help with that.  


I think that farmer-to-farmer or harvester-to-harvester cross-pollination and teaching is also really important.  I think education is a really important part of it, too.  We all want to be doing a better job here in Maine of teaching young people about fisheries and aquaculture and how to make a living on the water.  I work with a lot of incredibly passionate educators and teachers who are trying to get those topics into the classroom, show people that there are lots of different skills that are needed in the industry.  You don't have to be a fisherman or a farmer.  You could be working in accounting, HR, marketing, or sales for any of these marine resource companies.  I'm mentioning that because I feel like cultivating the next generation that's going to inherit these fisheries sea farming, and marine resource industries is also a long game of building resilience into the system, too.


Q:        [1:05:23] Absolutely.  I'm curious.  Do you feel like most farmers are able to make the adaptations they want to?


A:        [1:05:37] That's a good question.  I guess I'm not sure if I can answer.  We support farmers often in trying to find solutions that work for them, and farmers, harvesters, – everyone is working with limited resources and a finite amount of hours in the day.  I don't know.  I see a lot of success in that space.  I think if you ask the average farmer, “Are you doing everything that you want to be doing, or do you want to be doing more,” they're going to say more.  I think that's what it's like to be a farmer or to be a harvester.  You’re always chasing the ball and trying to plan as best you can for what's next.  


Part of the challenge on the farming side, as opposed to maybe the fishing side, is a lot of times, you're not making money for several years.  It might take you – here in Maine right now, it can take a few years to get a lease.  That would be to get your application through the state process for leasing the area that you want to farm in.  That can take a little bit of time.  Then you're going to plant your crop.  Seaweed, you plant it in the fall, you harvest it in the spring.  That's a pretty quick return on your investment, but it's a pretty low-value crop.  Something like shellfish is going to be a higher value crop, but it's going to take a year and a half on the fast end, maybe three years in a colder place to grow.  So, if you're starting a business, you need to be ready to not be making any money off of it for several years.  That's part of the math, I think, in the sustainability and the resilience piece, too, for a lot of small startup farmers.  


Q:        [1:07:47] Can you think of any adaptations or other future strategies that you think a lot of people really want to make but can't or think are going to happen soon?  


A:        [1:08:04] I don't know.  Yeah, I guess I can.  One example that comes to mind that's playing out right now is – I was speaking earlier about vibrio.  That has always been something that state regulators do a really good job of watching out for the consumer and making sure that the oysters that we eat are safe.  A lot of that regulation in Maine is actually – it came from industry.  Using the Damariscotta River as an example, basically, farmers got together and said, “Hey, we're seeing more of this.  We're worried about it.  We want to institute some rules for ourselves to make sure that the product is staying cool, and we're minimizing the chances that anyone would get sick from this, from vibrio.”  


Until this year, those controls, which include – they’re in place from maybe June to October of each year, so the warmest months when this would be the most risk, and they include things like getting your product – you have a certain amount of time to get your product out of the water and to the dealer, or it needs to be on ice.  You need to get your product down to temperature within a certain amount of time.  You need to shade your product when you're harvesting it.  These are all protective measures that reduce the risk of anything bad happening to the consumer on the far end.  


This year, for the first time, those control measures are being implemented statewide.  That’s because warming water being a contributing factor, the Department of Marine Resources is trying to be proactive about what they see as an increased risk of vibrio, not just in those growing areas that were previously regulated, but anywhere in the state.  That's a new reality for everyone who was outside those growing areas where that already existed, and that's a lot of conversation and back and forth and feedback between regulators and seed farmers about how those are going to play out.  It is pushing farmers to think about changes that they might need to make.  


One example I'll give that's come up right now, as it's written, has to do with home sales.  Under the vibrio control measures, people won't be able to sell out of their homes in certain cases anymore, and that's something that some shellfish farmers do.  That's pushing some folks to say, OK, then what do I need to do to maybe I'm building a small dealer space on my property, or maybe I need to change something about the way that I'm distributing my product, or maybe that previous sales channel that I had isn't open to me in the same way anymore.  That's a long-winded downstream impact of how an environmental change then affects the regulation that's needed, then affects the way that a farmer might do business or handle their product.  


I imagine that's going to push other changes.  Down to a very basic example, there's a lot more people this summer who are going to be thinking about – I need a lot of ice, and I need it all the time, and there's not a ton of industrial ice makers on the coast of Maine.  Access to ice sounds so simple, but it's really important, and it's now more a part of the business landscape for people than it might have been before.  That’s an example of something that working waterfront, in general, might need to adapt to.  We might need to get more ice makers.  We might need to think about how to support people in purchasing them together and sharing equipment, all that kind of stuff.


Q:        [1:12:10] Yeah, absolutely.  Thank you.  As you look towards the future, what would you say is your biggest concern for Maine's marine environment?


A:        [1:12:29] I don't know.  I guess climate change.  It sounds so simple, but the environmental changes that are coming from it are really serious.  They're changing the way that people do business and make a living, and in some cases, taking tools out of the toolbox that people used to have before.  Those environmental changes are also driving a lot of physical and cultural changes, and the storms that we had this past winter are a great example.  It's hard to track because we don't have a ton of data about this, but some estimates I've heard are that we lost as much as 60% of our working waterfront infrastructure, and that means things like docks and piers and wharves, and that's devastating for the fishery and for farmers and everyone who relies on that infrastructure.  


So, there’s that piece, the physical devastation piece, that I worry about.  In Maine, over the last decades, we've seen plenty of fisheries disappear, and fishermen are incredibly resilient.  They're incredibly bright.  They're really good at handling things that come up, and when the resource disappears or isn't harvestable anymore, it's hard to find a way around that or through that.  That’s what I would say is my biggest fear.  When I talk to young people, I mean people of all ages, but especially young people, I hear that reflected a lot.


Q:        [1:14:13] Yeah.  Going off of that last thread, I’m going to rephrase this question, thinking about Sea Grant and your position on advocacy.  What do you think a lot of people want to tell policymakers their biggest priority should be when they think about the future and climate change?  


A:        [1:14:28] Yeah, this is one of those questions I can't really answer – anything policy-related, so I'll pass on that one.


Q:        [1:14:34] Great.  Have you participated, or farmers you know – have they participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training for aquaculture?


A:        [1:14:48] That's a good question.  I'm not sure that I know of any trainings that are climate-specific.  I think climate is something we should be talking about more in our training programs.  Right now, it's a topic that comes up with certain curriculum pieces, but we don't have a broad look at it.  I think that would be really useful.  There's definitely some organizing around climate.  I would say – I think it's called – the Shellfish Growers Climate Coalition would be a good example of farmers that are coming together to organize around climate issues and advocate for themselves on that front.  But as far as climate training that is specific to fisheries and aquaculture, I'm not familiar with those.


Q:        [1:15:42] Do you think there are particular strategies that aquaculturists would really like to see that would help them build resilience against climate?


A:        [1:15:53] Yeah, that's a good question.  Going back to the vibrio example, there are a lot of shellfish growers this summer in Maine who are going to be learning, as they go about how to comply with those regulations.  The industry as a whole is totally –people understand why those exist.  They are really invested in delivering a really safe and quality product to their consumers, and it is still going to be a new challenge to learn how to do that.  Can you say the question one more time?  


Q:        [1:16:42] Sure.  I’m curious if there are strategies, trainings, anything like that that you think people in the industry would really like to see with reference to resilience and climate.


A:        [1:16:58] I don't know.  I would say – I think the needs that I hear are just around, “How do I deal with this?  What do I do when this happens?  What do I need to be thinking about down the road?”  Going back to storms for a minute, I feel this winter that we were fortunate – sea farmers.  There was some gear loss.  There was some damage to farms, but it could have been a lot worse.  I think that's an example of something where, 10 years from now, I won't be surprised if we are spending more time and energy training people on how to rapidly prepare for an oncoming storm.  Some gear is better suited to sinking, for example, than others.  Some of these changes might drive other changes in the actual stuff that people are using to farm.  


Farming is also really place based, and so one of the most important decisions you make as a sea farmer is picking the place you're going to be doing your farming.  I don't know of any examples of this yet, but certainly, it's possible that a place that used to be really good for growing kelp or shellfish 20 years ago won't be good 10 years from now.  That's going to be another reality for farmers.  


Something else that's coming to mind, I would say, as something that we see more and more farmers doing is just collecting environmental data at their sites.  They're tracking temperature or pH or salinity, and alongside that, we see – I've talked to two or three folks this year who are building startups around buoys or environmental monitoring tools or sensors specifically for aquaculture farms.  That’s kind of a new niche.  So, those are requests we get from farmers sometimes, too, of, “Hey, I feel like I need to know more about this environmental parameter.  I'm seeing it change at my site, and I want to have more information about it.  What's the best way for me to do that?”  So, better monitoring and sensing tools would be a good example.  


Q:        [1:19:31] Are there any changes you're seeing that are non-environmental that are really impacting aquaculture in Maine?


A:        [1:19:37] Totally.  Definitely.  This sounds funny to say, but affordable housing is one that's affecting all of us everywhere, but certainly on the coast of Maine.  We had a lot of we had an influx of new residents during COVID, and part of that drove a huge increase in the price of home sales and rent, so it's increasingly harder to find a place to live on the coast of Maine, and that makes it harder for farmers to source labor.  When I worked at Mook Sea Farm, I worked with plenty of folks who – you had to live within an hour because we have an on-call system.  If there was an alarm or an issue in the hatchery, there was a rotating list, and you might get a phone call.  You need to be able to respond within an hour, but we had a bunch of staff members who lived right on that one-hour line, and that's a long haul.  Not everybody can or wants to be driving that far to work.  


We collaborate with and support plenty of apprenticeship, internship, or externship programs that are designed to kind of expose people to careers in aquaculture, and one of their biggest challenges is finding a place to house their intern for that summer or their farm seasonal laborer.  That’s a big one that comes to mind.  As the population of Maine changes, which it will continue to do forever, there's a continual effort to help people understand the practices, the cultural heritage, and the realities of fishing and sea farming.  


I think that that’s also a long-haul change.  It goes back to that social license piece of how do you help people understand what it is, the value that it brings, the challenges that it brings, and the benefits that it has.  Because the leasing process for a farm site in Maine allows for public input as it should.  It's shared water.  It's part of the public resource.  We sometimes see tension in that space.  You might want to put a farm somewhere, and somebody else might not think that that's a good idea, or they might not want to look at it from where they live on the shore.  


Those are social dynamics that play out in the aquaculture space when it comes to the leasing process and then having a farm in that place thereafter.  So, yeah, I think those social factors affect all of us, and they play out in specific ways when it comes to making a living on the water.


Q:        [1:22:49] Are you seeing any ways that people are trying to adapt to those?  


A:        [1:22:53] Definitely.  Well, the housing one – that's a tough nut.  We're all trying to crack that, for sure.  I think that in that specific case, on the sea farming side, it's everything from support organizations trying to provide more funding to account for that reality with their interns to my neighbor farmers got a cousin who's got a couch, and that's what's going to make this employment situation work for the summer, and everything in between.  


On the social dynamic side, that sometimes tension, conflict, perceived conflict, or need for more information and communication drives organizations like Sea Grant to say, “How can we engage?  How can we better educate people about this process?”  In some cases, it has driven changes in the process itself, and steps have been added in to allow for more public input or more communication between people applying for a lease and people who might live in the area.  Definitely, I see, across the board, a lot of work by farmers to just get engaged in their communities, to get to know their neighbors, to learn who's using the waters in their area, where the fishing grounds are, to build that social license and that trust with the people that are in that community.  


That can look like everything from bringing some oysters to your neighbor who sees your farm site all the time to coaching a local soccer team or having a table at a community event to share information about your farm and everything in between.  There are lots of ways to do that community engagement, and it's a really important part of the puzzle because aquaculture happens in the public space often and in the public eye, and for most people, it's foreign.  It's something that they're not familiar with and that they don't know.  Most of the farmers that we work with feel a responsibility to try and bridge that gap as much as they can.  That’s a win-win for everybody when they're able to do that.  Yeah, absolutely.


Q:        [1:25:24] Can you talk about any positive change or opportunity you've seen?


A:        [1:25:31] Sure.  Just in general, in aquaculture?


Q:        [1:25:34] Yeah.


A:        [1:25:36] Sure.  I mean, it's hard to know where to start.  So much innovation on the small scale of how do we farm this thing better or develop this new market?  Kelp is a great example there because that's a relatively new sector in Maine.  In the last 10 years, it's grown tremendously, and that's great.  We need to grow more kelp, but also, there's a need to develop markets to make people want to eat it.  There’s so much interesting stuff happening in the seaweed space, from developing new products or ways of eating it – things that aren't edible – we're seeing a lot of startups and interest in Maine in things like making bioplastics out of kelp, putting it into cosmetic products or pharmaceuticals.  So, the types of resources and benefits that we can create from the things that we're growing, I think, has expanded a tremendous amount.  


Then, on another end of the spectrum, we're growing things in Maine that we didn't used to be growing.  Because I get to do a little work on the research side, I get to see some of that stuff as it's just starting.  There's a graduate student here who, part of his work, is trying to figure out, can we farm razor clams?  That's not something that's ever been done in Maine before.  In other places, people eat them.  It would be great to have maybe a reliable source that didn't take away from the wild population, if we could do that.  


I think my favorite – what gets me most excited is solutions or opportunities that benefit, for example, both farmers and wild harvesters, and scallops is a good example because both farmers and wild harvesters right now depend on wild seed.  We're working on trying to figure out how to grow scallops in a hatchery setting, but it is tough.  They're very needy.  They have a really long larval period.  So, until we crack that nut, everyone uses wild seed, and I've heard scallop farmers share about how they feel that their farms are adding more reproductive material back into the ecosystem, and that's a boon for the wild fishery.  


There's so much demand that – farm scallops, wild scallops – people want them both.  They're both a delicious product that you can feel good about buying.  A bunch of my colleagues just got back from an exchange trip to France, where they were trying to learn more about the scallop fishery there.  There’s plenty of things we can do for scallops as an example that benefit people across the spectrum who interact with that resource.  That kind of collaboration in the seafood space is really exciting.  We all know getting people together who come from different places usually ends up with a better solution, and maybe not to the problems that we thought we were going to be solving in the first place.  


Q:        [1:29:18] Yeah.  As you look towards the future, what is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [1:29:28] I hope and I think that people are going to continue to understand and value the cultural piece of it, the heritage of it, the way of life.  I think across the board, part of the reason that sea farmers and fishermen do what they do is because they care about the resource that they're working with.  They want to be responsible stewards.  They love working on the water, and it's such a special thing about living here.  That makes me hopeful.  I think just seeing people coming to Maine wanting to be a part of this, feeling like it's a way to grow food, for example, that they can feel good about, feed their community in a way that's good for the planet – that makes me hopeful because Maine isn't the most diverse place, and we need young people and people of different backgrounds and people with new ideas that are going to come here and help us figure out how we're going to face whatever's happening next.  


When I meet people who moved here from California to work on an oyster farm, that makes me hopeful because that tells me we're doing something right, and if people can see themselves in the work, then it's going to make the industry stronger and more resilient and a more welcoming place for people that might want to be a part of it.


Q:        [1:31:22] Have you noticed any changes in women's presence/status/participation over time?  


A:        [1:31:30] It's a great question.  The first thing I'll say is we don't have enough data about this.  I get asked all the time, “How many women farmers are there in Maine?”  We don't have a super accurate way of answering that question right now.  There are many, and there are, from my perspective, increasingly more.  The workshop series we were talking about earlier, I think, is an indication that there's a lot of interest in support for that group.  I think when you look at farm ownership and lease holding across the board, it's still primarily very male-dominated.  The fact that you can enter as a small farmer and start on a small scale is a good thing and is helpful.  But when it comes to accessing capital, making sales, interactions in the community, certainly we hear from women anecdotally and in research that those can still be challenging spaces.  


I think that we're seeing more and more women and non-binary folks and people from underrepresented groups interested in it, and that’s a cycle that helps feed itself.  We have a lot of leadership positions in aquaculture that are held by women in the state, so heads of research organizations, large companies, regulatory leadership.  A lot of my mentors and people that I look up to are women and men, of course, but it helps to have representation in those roles because we know that globally and, in general, women hold about 50% of roles in the fisheries space, and they tend to be represented more in the processing/marketing roles, and less so when it comes to things like owning the business, being the one doing the harvesting.  I think we're seeing more representation in that space in Maine, and it feels to me that it's picking up momentum.  


Q:        [1:34:01] Great.  Is there anything else you want to share before we conclude the interview?


A:        [1:34:08] I don't think so.  My brain’s out of ideas.


Q:        [1:34:11] Hillary, do you have any questions before we close?


F:        [1:34:14] Just one small one that is in the many things you told us about these impacts – and I just wanted to ask a follow-up about the impacts of green crabs, I guess, particularly on oyster or mussel farmers since they’re prey of the green crabs.  I was just wondering if you had any more to say about what those impacts are.  Is it that they're getting into the cages and eating them?  


A:        [1:34:38] Yeah, that's a good question.  So, one example might be for folks who do what we call bottom culture – so, they're spreading out their oyster seed on the bottom of their lease rather than having it in a floating cage or some other structure.  It's a totally different way of farming.  The oysters need less handling and stuff from you.  You generally plant them out and then come and get them two years later or maybe three years later.  You also accept that you're going to lose a much higher percentage of that crop than if you were holding them all in a contained place and checking them all the time.  Those oysters, for example, are subject to predation, and it is kind of mind-boggling the size oyster that a green crab can take on and get inside of.  So, that's an impact.  


Farmers take care to plant out seed that's big enough that they feel like it has a good chance of surviving that type of predation.  But I've seen some pretty bone-chilling videos of green crabs eating two-inch oysters.  That surprised me.  So, predation would be one way that it plays out.  I would say this is something we know less about, but when mussels or oysters are in that – so, for mussels, for example, where we're using wild seed, green crabs may also be eating some of that wild seed or eating them when they're in larval form, and that affects how much is left for farmers to collect and then grow out.  Those would be a couple examples.


F:        [1:36:18] How much (inaudible) bottom culture, much less than –?


A:        [1:36:26] That’s a good question.  I don't know what the percent breakdown is.  I would say more farmers are doing top culture in Maine than bottom culture, but some farmers do both, and that's another resiliency piece that people build in if they have multiple sites.  They might have one site that's really good for this type and one site that's really good for this type.  That allows them, in some cases, to market a couple of different products: top-grown/bottom-grown.  Other farmers do one or the other, and that's how they stick to it.  I don't know what the exact breakdown is, but people are definitely doing it.  


F:        [1:37:05] Thank you.  


Q:        [1:37:06] Great.  Then, I will go ahead and turn this off. 


END OF FILE"
"11","Q:        [0:00] Great.  So we’d like to start with how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:05] Well, my name is Emma Fernald.  I'm 27.  I live on Little Cranberry Island full-time, and I have been working on a lobster boat and I have a scallop farm. 


Q:        [0:21] In 27, what year were you born?


A:        [0:24] ’97.  Yeah.


Q:        [0:26] Great.  And can you tell me about where you grew up? 


A:        [0:29] So I grew up between Mount Desert Island and Little Cranberry Island.  I went to school in Boston for college, but I grew up splitting my time between MDI and Little Cranberry.  I stayed six months on MDI while I'd go to school, and then I'd commute for a couple months on either end, and then spent most of the summer and fall and spring on Little Cranberry.


Q:        [0:59] And where are your parents from and what did they do? 


A:        [1:03] My dad is from Little Cranberry. He's sixth generation on Little Cranberry.  And my mom is from Texas. 


Q:        [1:15] And so is the Fernald side your dad’s side – 


A:        [1:16] Yeah.


Q:        [1:17] – sixth generation.  Is that like do people go back much further than that?  I mean – I mean –


A:        [1:20] There are a couple families.  There's the Spurlings and the Hadlocks that are kind of OG Islesford families.  Little Cranberry is the island, Islesford is the town on the island.  They're interchangeable though.  There's only one town.


        So those two families are kind of the originals and then the Fernalds were like right after that.  So.


Q:        [1:43] Do you know sort of like what era or like decade that was about the first Fernald (inaudible)?  


A:        [1:48] It was 17 – late 1700s.  Yeah. 


Q:        [1:50] And what brought them here?  Do you know? 


A:        [1:53] I don't really know.  I know they're from –  there's English Fernalds and Northern French Fernalds.  I don't know why they came.  I think that the first Fernald to come to Little Cranberry was a surgeon on the boat.  So yeah, then we transitioned to the lobster fishing.


Q:        [2:13] Yeah.  So was your father a lobster fisherman? 


A:        [2:16] Yeah.  He's sixth generation lobster fishermen too.  Yeah. 


Q:        [2:20] Great.  And what did your mom do? 


A:        [2:22] My mom waited tables for like 20 years and then when she had my brother and I, she just took care of us, and she knows she's worked like odd jobs throughout, working up flower shops and waiting tables, bartending. 


Q:        [2:41] And are your parents out here or do they split their time?  


A:        [2:45] My mom lives in Bar Harbor full-time and then my dad still splits his time between Bar Harbor and Little Cranberry. 


Q:        [2:55] And how about you?  Are you here year-round?  Or do you split?


A:        [2:57] Yeah. I'm here.  This is my fifth year full-time on the island, and my partner and I just bought a house out here two years ago.  So we're here for the long haul. 


Q:        [3:06] And so you mentioned a brother.  How old is he and what does he do and where does he live? 


A:        [3:13] He is 29.  (laughter)  And he lives in Bar Harbor.  And he works at a restaurant.  And he does the pastry at a restaurant and all the prep. 


Q:        [3:24] And that's your only sibling?


A:        [3:26] I also have a half brother and he lives in Baltimore and he is an accountant.  Yeah.


Q:        [3:34] Have either of your other siblings?  We're going to get a lot more into your history and your fishery and the fishing (inaudible; overlapping dialogue) in addition to the fishing.  But have either of them had any role?  


A:        [3:42] My brother who is my full brother, Coleman, he was not interested.  And my half brother, Marcus, he would sometimes stern with my dad when he would be here for the summers.  So.  But he was never like interested.


Q:        [3:58] And we've finally done this in your history.  And we've definitely already touched on this.  And your history is very rich.  But we have – do you have any history of fishing in your family?  


A:        [4:08] Yes, I do.  So I am seventh generation.  My dad's a lobsterman.  Two of his brothers are a lobsterman.  My grandfather was a lobsterman too.  And then going back to the first generation. 


        So, yes, I do.  (laughter)


Q:        [4:25] And then in addition to directly fishing, do you have any history of family working in other roles in the fishing industry, such as supporting with bookkeeping or working more in the fish processing and marketing side or bait or gear? 


A:        [4:40] I – I mean, not formally, but I think there's definitely a lot of wives doing a lot of the – I know my grandmother used to help my grandfather paint buoys.  And like growing up, I would make bait bags for my dad on the couch while I was watching TV.  


        And yeah, there's no formal job, but I think that it kind of takes a little bit of a crew to get it all going.  So.


Q:        [5:09] How about your mom?  Do you remember her doing any of those types of things?


A:        [5:12] I mean, not in the same way that directly related to fishing.  But my dad, when I was growing up, he'd be gone hours before I’d wake up and he wouldn't get back until like seven at night.  So, it was like he couldn't exist without my mom doing all the stuff that she did.  (laughter)


Q:        [5:26] Definitely.  And then you mentioned a little bit about your education. Could you kind of take us back like, did you go to schools on MDI – and you mentioned Boston?  Could you describe a little about your educational background? 


A:        [5:47] So, I went to elementary and middle school at the Conners Emerson School in Bar Harbor.  And then I went to MDI High School.  And then I went to Leslie University for college.  And I studied art there.  I just did a four-year program. Yeah.  Graduated in 2019 and moved here. 


Q:        [6:08] And you came right back. 


A:        [6:10] Yeah. 


Q:        [6:11] And you mentioned, I think, a partner.  We – are you married or you're – 


A:        [6:15] I have a live-in boyfriend.  So, we own the house together.  And he's also a fisherman.  Yeah.


Q:        [6:23] And do you have any children? 


A:        [6:27] No.  (laughter).  I don’t.


Q:        [6:29] If you had children, would you want them to go into fishing?


A:        [6:33] I mean, I wouldn't discourage anybody from going into it, but I just feel like, you know, uncertain times for me.  So, it feels like even more uncertain times for like potentially like 20 years from now, 30 years from now.  So.


Q:        [6:50] I guess we'll come back to all (inaudible; overlapping) –


A:        [6:52] OK.  Yeah.


Q:        [6:53] – a lot of questions about that.  So, I'd love to come back to that.  Maybe kind of going with the more like basics first in terms of your role in the sector.  Like, how do you describe your work and your role in the fishing and aquaculture industry in Maine?  And that could include like your trajectory, like what you did in the past and what you do now. 


A:        [7:10] So, I work on my dad's boat right now.  I'm sternman on his boat.  I've been sterning for five years.  I've been on his boat for three.  And I've had a scallop farm for two.  I'm also first on the wait list to get my lobster license.  So, hopefully next year.  


        But yeah, so I definitely see myself continuing this path and I'd like to be my own captain soon.  And then I'm really excited about the scallop farm too. It's been really cool learning about how it all works.  And there's so few farms in the United States, let alone in – in Maine. 


        So, I've had like a couple mentors that have more established farms that have been really helpful and super generous with information, which is something I'm not that used to going into the fishing industry. 


        But – but, yeah, so it's been, it's been really awesome learning about that too. 


Q:        [8:20] Yeah, and so folks in the lobby didn't do the student license program. You are in the regular (inaudible) to do this. 


A:         [8:21] Yeah, I had a student license for a little while when I was really young, when I was like seven, eight, nine.  And I had five traps and my dad would just call me when he'd get in from fishing and then we go all my traps, and then that was kind of it.  But then, you know, I turned like 13 and I was like, yeah, I don't really – I'm not interested in this.  


        And then when I came back to Maine after – after school, I wasn't planning on staying in Maine. Actually I like packed up my car and I was driving to California, and I got T-boned in Brunswick, Maine and it totaled my car.  And I was like, OK, well, what am I going to do now?  


        And I came back and then my dad jokingly said that his friend was looking for a sternman, and I was like, OK, I'll do that.  And then I started doing it and I was like, OK, I like this a lot.  And so I continued to do it.


Q:        [9:29] When were you headed out, did you have something like (inaudible) with you? 


A:        [9:31] I had no plan.  (laughter).  I like looked back, and I'm like, what was I thinking?  But – but yeah, I just wanted to kind of like get an idea of what was out there and basically find a town that I liked and stay and see how long I wanted to stay.  Yeah.


Q:        [9:45] And so you're on the regular license wait list. How many more people have to retire?  I mean, it's great that you're next coming.  But I know there's like the entry exit entry (inaudible). 


A:        [9:56] Yeah.  Well, it's – so living out on the island, it's a little bit different.  So I'm on what they call a limited entry island wait list.  And so I'm on a wait list that is exclusively for this island.  So there's still like a certain number of licenses that the island can hold.  


        So our number is 23.  And so basically there have to be – it's a one-in one-out ratio.  But right now we're at the number.  So we're just kind of seeing what happens.  And people, I mean – I mean, it's great.  But everybody wants to just fish until they croak.  So.  (laughter)


Q:        [10:39] People seem to hold on long.


A:        [10:42] Yeah.


Q:        [10:43] So you're on the wait list.  And – for your lobster license, do you hold other – what other licenses or permits do you hold, including for your aquaculture program? 


A:        [10:53] So I have a limited purpose aquaculture license, which isn't technically a lease, but it's a version of a lease pretty much.  And they're just like one year sites that you – they don't want me to call them leases, but I don't know what else to call them – that you lease from the state for a year at a time. You can renew them for up to three years.  


        So I have that that permit right now.  And that's how I grow my scallops is on that lease site. 


Q:        [11:23] How big is your leased area? 


A:        [11:26] Eight hundred square feet.  (laughter).  Yeah.  Yep.  


Q:        [11:31] I guess mostly vertical (inaudible).


A:        [11:33] Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just basically like a long line with nets hanging off of it.  So it's just like one long 800 – well, it’s 400 feet, but yeah. 


Q:        [11:43] And then in terms of your – in terms of lobstering, working with your dad, do you guys fish in shore?  Offshore?  Both? 


A:        [11:50] We fish both.  So, I mean closest in shore we fish is like right – right up on the shore.  And then for the south shore, we fish is like 12 miles offshore, which is like not that offshore, but it's further off than the inshore people fish.  So.


Q:        [12:08] Do you own your own boat? 


A:        [12:10] I do.  Well, I own a boat with my partner.  We bought a 32-foot Jarvis Newman.  And we purchased that in January of 2024.  So it's a newer purchase for us.  And I use that for my scallop farm.  And my partner is a diver.  And he uses that for diving jobs.  And then we both are planning to get our lobster licenses at some point.  So we will use that boat when that happens too. 


Q:        [12:40] All right.  So you both could use (inaudible) for that. 


A:        [12:43] Yeah.  Yeah. 


Q:        [12:45] Great.  And then in terms of – so what – I guess what got you interested in scalloping because it is rare to do that around here in (inaudible; overlapping dialogue).


A:        [12:53] Yeah. 


Q:        [12:54] And yeah, how did that start for you? 


A:        [12:57] Well, I was interested in doing something on top of lobstering that was also on the water.  Just because, you know, everybody's kind of not sure about the future of the industry.  And I wanted to be involved. 


        I just – I feel like once I started working on the water, I was like, OK, I don't want to do what I used to do ever again.  Like I want to just do this. 


        And I was interested in aquaculture, but I wasn't really that interested in growing oysters just because there's so many oyster farms now and mussels.  I've learned it's like hard to make money growing mussels. 


        And then I read – I read this article in the New York Times about a scallop farmer in Stonington.  And I was like, huh, scallop farm.  Like I've never heard of that.  And so I looked up his farm.  I just Googled him.  And I got his phone number, and I called him.  And I was like, can I just come out for a day and I'll just work on the farm.  I just want to see what it's like.  And I'm interested in trying this.  And he was like, sure.  And he let me come out on the farm for a day.


        And I saw the setup because I just couldn't really visualize it.  And once I saw the setup, I was like, OK.  I can do this.  I'm going to try and do this.  (laughter)


Q:        [14:16] So one day out there and then you kind of put it in an application for –   


A:        [14:18] Yeah.  So basically the way – what – what the scallop farmer that I was – that I visited recommended was to buy a spat collection license.  And spat is basically baby scallops.  So it's just like a $75 license that you purchase from the state. 


        So I did that.  I set out spat collection bags around the time of the scallops spawn. Just – I just wanted to basically see if this was even like viable because if I can't collect the spat, then I can't grow scallops because there's no hatchery in the state. 


        So – so I did that, and then it was an awesome collection.  I was super happy without – when I was not expecting it to go well.  


        So it was that was really great.  And then once I had the spat, that's when I started my application process.  And I ended up selling a lot of the spat to another farmer in Midcoast. But now I have – this of my third year collecting spat now.  So yeah.


Q:        [15:24] And then – yeah, so I see on your website, you guys – you sell spat.  You sell spat to a few farms now, or most important ones. 


A:        [15:30] Yeah, it's most – it's mostly been one this year.  I don't know how many it's going to be because he seemed to like get his limit. 


        But yeah, there's not a ton of people doing this. So there's not a ton of people buying spat.  But I've had like the Darling Marine Center buy spat for me.  I'm hoping they’ll be other people that are interested because I have way too much.  So. 


Q:        [15:56] And then in terms of the scallops, like what – how many years have you grown them.  Like have you gotten into market-size scallops? 


A:        [16:02] Yeah. 


Q:        [16:06] And how many years do you grow yourself or kind of what does spat side of the business looks like.


A:        [16:08] Yeah.  So I have some two-year old scallops right now that are market size.  Yeah. Three years is what they say is like the full-grown scallop.  But the nice thing about scallop farming is that you can harvest the different sizes but you can't harvest at for wild caught scallops.  


        So I can harvest what's called a petite scallop.  And these are like one-and-a-half to two-year old scallops usually, depending on how long they're taking to grow.  I was able to reach the petite size at one-and-a-half years, which was awesome.  


        So I do have some. I'm really going to start selling them next summer though. Yeah. 


Q:        [16:48] And then who do you sell to now, or who do you think you’re going to sell it to like market-size scallops?


A:        [16:53] I'm really hoping to – I'd such – I have such a small operation because it's just me.  I don’t have any employees.  So I'm literally just working after fishing or on my days off.  So it's a small farm.  


        So I'm really hoping to keep it as local as possible.  I'd like to do like farm drops on the – on Little Cranberry, and just have people sign up for a weekly farm drop of scallops.  


        And then I'd like to just work with local restaurants doing more like specials than regular distribution just because – it's just hard for me to get to our harbor once a week or wherever – Portland.  So yeah, that's more what I'm thinking. 


        And then I have a couple that I'm friends with that has a catering company out here and they were like super interested in working with them.  So I want to work with them a lot.  Yeah.


Q:        [17:50] And then in terms of beyond capture fishing and aquaculture harvesting itself, we have some follow-up questions to see about your experience kind of in other kind of aspects of, you know, pre-harvest and post-harvest activities.


        So do you have experience in bookkeeping, date or gear preparation?


A:        [18:13] I do have some bookkeeping experience.  I've been doing the bookkeeping for a nonprofit out here for the last two-and-a-half years.  I recently let that position go.  But I do have some experience in bookkeeping, although it is like so not my thing.  (laughter)


Q:        [18:32] Could you do it for your own – for your business, like for your farm? 


A:        [18:37] Yeah, I've just started kind of doing that, selling merch and stuff, so now I'm trying to keep better track of my finances.  (laughter)  Yeah.


Q:        [18:44] And then there's no bait for the scallop farm, but I imagine you work with bait in your role.


A:        [18:51] Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, yeah.  That's just the nice thing about the scallop farm.  I don't have to buy feed, but yeah, I work with bait.  


Q:        [19:00] And then gear preparation, probably both sides for capture fishing also (inaudible). 


A:        [19:06] Yeah, I do a lot of gear work for my dad, just mending traps.  And if he buys like spec traps from the lot, we have to like, you know, change fence around and things like that.  


        And then for the scallop farm, I don't have a ton of gear work to do, but it's a lot of pressure washing.  A lot of cleaning nets.  And then sometimes I have to mend the nets if they rip or something. 


Q:        [19:34] And you're using lantern nets or – 


A:        [19:37] I'm using mostly pearl nets.  And then I'm hoping to do some ear hanging.  Yeah.


Q:        [19:45] And then do you have any experience in kind of post-harvest processing, marketing or trade?


A:        [19:51] No, I do not.  (laughter)


Q:        [19:53] Although I guess for your own scallops and the spat, I mean, if you consider – you know, looking for customers and getting them products, that would probably apply on that side.


A:        [20:01] Yeah, I guess selling spat, I have had some experience.  But I think next summer will be the big post-market.  


Q:        [20:10] I guess also for your scallops story, are you shucking?  Like if you do ca – or are you just kind of give people the whole scallop and the consumer (inaudible)? 


A:        [20:19] With the LPA, I'm not allowed to harvest the – I have to shuck.  Once I apply for a standard lease and get approved, then I can sell the whole scallop, but with the type of LPA that I have, I have to shuck.


Q:        [20:35] You get to do that seasonally to work for your dad.


A:        [20:38] Yeah.


Q:        [20:39] OK.


A:        [20:40] Yeah.  


Q:        [20:41] Interesting.  


M:        [20:42] I don't realize there's a difference between the LPA and the (inaudible).  


A:        [20:43] Yeah.


Q:        [20:45] And then how about in terms of kind of advocacy or community-based organizations related to fisheries?


A:        [20:51] I don't really have much experience with it, no.


Q:        [20:59] And then any experience and sort of research and development side around aquaculture or fishing?


A:        [21:06] I mean, I don’t – I'm interested in it, and I've definitely spoken with a lot of people from Maine Sea Grant and Darling Marine Center.  I took a class on – called ""Aquaculture and Shared Waters.""  So I have done my own research, but I have not really been involved in any research.


Q:        [21:27] How was your experience with aquaculture in Shared Waters program?


A:        [21:30] It was good.  I mean, I think – because I'm farming scallops, and there are so few people doing it, I think it was – and ended up being a lot of material that I had already read online.  But I think as the years go on, somebody farming scallops, that would be a great class to take.  But it was just so new when I took that class that it was mostly about oysters.  Which is great.  But– 


M:        [22:04] (inaudible).


A:        [22:05] Yeah.


Q:        [22:07] And then also, do you have any experience in working in hatcheries of any kind and fisheries?


A:        [22:12] No.  Not at all.  No. 


Q:        [22:15] And then what about in terms of like food service?  Kind of food customer interface on the seafood sort of focus, or – 


A:        [22:23] Yeah, I waited tables at the Islesford Dock Restaurant for nine years, so I had a lot of experience serving seafood.  Yeah.


Q:        [22:31] Great.  And I know it's going to be a hard question for a small business owner, but – if you could take us through, like what does an average day of work look like for you?  And maybe that like at different seasons, like – 


A:        [22:44] Yeah.  


Q:        [22:45] Yeah.  


A:        [22:46] Well, it depends, I guess, on what-– what exactly I'm working on that day.  I am lobstering in the summer, four or five days a week.  We leave at 5.30, get back around 2:00 or 1:30.  If the weather is really nice, then I'll probably go out to the farm for a couple hours and work on the farm.  If it's not nice, I probably won't.  


        And then if I have a day off from fishing, then I'll go to the farm early.  I'll leave – I mean, not as early as I would for lobstering, but I'll go out to the farm and I'll spend probably six to eight hours on the farm just thinning nets and doing stocking density and hopefully harvesting more soon.  


        In the spring time, when I am starting to go through my spat bags, that's just like a lot of scooping tiny scallops into nets.  And that takes a really long time to get through all those.  


        But yeah, and then once I get into the winter season, I stop fishing usually around Christmas time.  And then the scallops will pretty much not grow all winter because the water’s so cold.  So I don't have to do much for the scallops.  


        In the winter I check on the line every once in a while and just make sure everything looks good.  But I'm not really sorting nets or anything in the winter.  So it's my nap time.


Q:        [24:29] And is there any like sinking – you don't sink gear?


A:        [24:33] I don't sink gear yet.  It's all in nets.  So I don't have to do any of that.  But it's nerve racking with the way the storms were last winter.  I was like, well, maybe they'll just not be there like.  (laughter)  There’s lots of snow.


Q:        [24:48] Yeah, could you talk a little bit about – did the storms impact your farm?


A:        [24:53] It didn't.  I mean, I don't know how, but it did not.  I have a friend with an oyster farm who lost a few cages.  But luckily, the direction of the wind during those big storms was in favor of my farm site.  So.  


Q:        [25:17] So how far –


A:        [25:18] Yeah.


Q:        [25:19] Could you describe what kind of – you’d say like how far is it from the dock and how – what kind of environment is it in?


A:        [25:23] It is about 400 feet from the shore off of Sutton Island.  It's in a little cove.  And it's about – I have two separate LPAs.  And they're each 200-foot long lines.  So they're just kind of like straight lines, 15 feet below the surface, all the nets hang off of them.  But scallops have to be grown in a protected area.  


        Anyways, that's kind of part of the criteria of what I was looking for, because they get seasick in wave motion, like too much wave motion.  Yeah, which is like ridiculous.  (laughter)


Q:        [26:09] I've heard they’re more sensitive than like the oyster, but I haven't heard that yet.  


A:        [26:15] Yeah, they're way more sensitive.  Yeah.  Yeah.


Q:        [26:20] Yeah.  That's really interesting.


A:        [26:22] Yeah.


Q:        [26:23] Different question.  How do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing sector, including how others perceive or treat you?  And that could be any – any – or many aspects of your identity in background?


A:        [26:38] I think my lineage really helps me.  I think a lot of people probably wouldn't have pictured me doing what I'm doing.  My – my first job on a boat, I got because my dad knew a guy.  And he was like, well.  And then when I got on the boat, he was like, we'll just see how it goes.  We're not going to promise anything.


        You know, it was like very like – and this was a guy I had known since I was like a baby.  So he was, you know, he was like, OK, I think he was a little nervous to take me out.  Make sure everything, you know, the safety and everything.  


        But I think for the most part, I've been treated really well, which is really nice.  I don't think that's everybody's experience, but I think that has a lot to do with my family.  I'm being such a big part of the fishery in the island.  And it's like half my family is working there.  So that's nice.


        I mean, when I was fishing out of Northeast Harbor, I definitely got like some little like dumb comments about like, oh, cute sternman or whatever, you know?  Just little things like that.  But for the most part, I feel like people have been really respectful and taken me seriously, which is nice and maybe not what I expected.  


        So yeah, I think – I don't know what my experience would be if I didn't have the fishing lineage, but I've had a pretty positive experience.  So, yeah.


Q:        [28:16] And then, do you notice any – since you are active in both kind of the capture of fishing side and aquaculture, I don't know how much you feel like those communities are similar or different or you're with them all the time.  Yeah.


A:        [28:27] They're so different.  Yeah, they're so different.  I went to an aquaculture conference in Providence last winter, and I was like, wow, these people are so different than the fishing community.  I mean, it's just like night and day.  And it's just the aquaculture group is just so much more diverse than the fishing group.  


        And I think a big part of why is because it's so hard to get a lobster license.  And there are a lot more women on the wait list than there have ever been, but the wait list takes so long that it's like all these women on the wait list have been waiting like 15 years to get their license.  


        So there's like, I think, 4% of the state’s licenses are women.  And now it's like, well, all these women who want to do it, they have to wait so long to do it, that it's hard to even diversify the lobster industry, at least for captains.  So it's just a totally different group.


        There's so many women doing aquaculture and like, I don't know very many female captains.  So.


Q:        [29:41] Do you think that like crew side is a little more di – has diversified more.


A:        [29:45] I definitely think the crew is diversified.  Yeah, I know a lot more women on Mount Desert Island who are crew.  And now there's a few more women that are crew on Little Cranberry too, which is great.  Yeah.


Q:        [30:01] And how does your role in the fishing aquaculture sector work with any family commitments or caregiving responsibilities you have, including if you don't have them now, like future plans for those.


A:        [30:13] Well, I mean, for me, because my family's so involved in fishing, I – and my partner fishes too.  It’s like, OK, we're all in the same schedule pretty much.  


        But yeah, I mean, I don't know if I'll have kids, but that it’s definitely something like, what am I going to put them in a car seat on the engine box?  Like, I'm not really sure how that would work because I am not interested in giving up my career.  


        So yeah, that would definitely complicate things.  If I decided to have a kid, they'd have to pull the gloves up and get in the bait, I guess.  (laughter)  But yeah.


Q:        [30:56] Have you seen – I'm just curious in the community out here.  Have you seen any women who work in the sector who would do that?


A:        [31:04] I was.  Yeah, there's I was not born when this was happening, but this woman, Stephanie Ali, she and her husband both were fishermen and she did exactly that.  She brought her kid in a car seat and sat on the engine box and they just snapped and she hauled, and I just think it's awesome.  Yeah.


Q:        [31:32] Now shifting to kind of focusing sort of on environmental changes, you kind of noticed in your time living out here and kind of being a part of industry.  Can you describe like what some of those environmental changes are that you might have noticed in the marine environment over time?


A:        [31:48] Yeah, I mean, from my time in lobstering, I can't say I've noticed a significant difference.  I've only been really, you know, consistent – consistently lobstering for five years and every year has just been so different.  It's just like every year, the shed happens at a different time. and it's just been so different every year.  So I haven't noticed like any kind of general pattern with that.  


        Just from living out here, you know, my whole life, I've definitely noticed like a difference in like the tidal creatures that we have.  Like, you know, I remember getting off the Mailboat and the pilings would just be like covered in sea stars and now you like never see them.  And then we used to be able to like pick mussels off the beach, and now there's like no mussels on the beach.  So I've noticed little things like that.


        And then I also, the storms that we had last winter, that was really – it was just a really crazy experience for all of us out here just because.  I mean, I think it was crazy for everybody on the coast, but we just rely on so many of the infrastructures on the water out here.  It's like, I don't think there's a single family out here that's not impacted by like the fishing co-op.  


        And just like watching everything go underwater, like all the docks go underwater and like buildings fall into the water, and we're all just like, wow, is this the new – is this what winter is going to look like now?  Or is this just like a one-off crazy storm that just had like the perfect wind direction matched up with like king tides?


        Just kind of wicking to see what happens this winter to see if this is just like what we're dealing with now.  


Q:        [33:46] You mentioned your farm was spared from luckily impacts of the storm, but can you talk about, yeah, like the co-op, what the working water frame, infrastructure here on the island, like how was that impacted by it specifically?


A:        [33:57] Yeah, we had – so our wood dock was – there was a couple planks on the town dock that were kind of like cock-eyed after the storm and needed to be refastened.  And then our steps going down to the Mailboat that everybody uses to get on and off the Mailboat, they needed to be tweaked a little bit.  


        The co-op luckily was like pretty much unfazed by it, which was like, yeah, it was very surprising.


        And then the restaurant dock, which is right next to the co-op, that had the worst damage.  They had to like rebuild the – half of the walkway that comes from the land out to the restaurant, and then their office building fell into the ocean.  


        And it, I mean, the water just came up so much higher than we've ever seen it come up before.  And then it also washed out an entire road on the backside of the island.  And then it washed out another road on the west side of the island.


        So, yeah, that was – it was – yeah, it was crazy and we still haven't recovered from it.  And we still have like what we call the Islesford Canyon on the west side of the island.  Um, and that still floods every king tide.  But, yeah, I don't know.  


Q:        [35:34] Do you have those (inaudible)?  Not all the roads have been (inaudible). 


A:        [35:39] One of the roads was repaired, but it's a privately owned road.  So there's only one house that's at the end of the road.  And so like a half mile long road and they had to pay out-of-pocket for that to be fixed.  


        And then, the other road is also on private property, but it's a big deal because our electricity for the island comes in at the end of that road.  And so no trucks can get down that road. 


        So if we have a – some kind of problem with our box where our electricity comes in, the trucks can't get down the road.  So they have to be able to either walk with all their equipment to the end of the road or they just can't get there.


        So we're waiting on disaster relief money to fix that road, which will be really important to do before the winter.  Because we have at least a few multi-day power outages a year in the winter.  So, yeah.


Q:        [36:42] And then, in terms of scallop farmer, I just – circling back to something you mentioned earlier, just seeing if you feel like it fits kind of in this topic of marine environment and change.  


        We mentioned power washing your gear.  So it sucks about biofouling or biofouling.  I know you haven’t been scallop farming for very long, but do you feel like that’s related to kind of changes going on in the marine environment or –


A:        [37:11] I actually even really pleasantly surprised by the amount of biofouling I've had.  But I think that's just in comparison to farm – the two farms that I've seen that are south of me.  And they’re in warmer water and they're more.  Where – we just are so much more exposed.  And there, they're all like up in these little islands, and the water so much warmer and species up.  


        And the amount of like sea squirts that I was seeing on their nets, I was like floored.  And I have not seen a single one on my nets.  So I mean, it could just be a matter of time until I start experiencing that, but right now, I'm not experiencing that at all.  I'm just getting seaweed, which is fine.  I can deal with that.


Q:        [37:55] Are you a deeper water – is it a deeper water site or it's just cooler here because of the latitude?


A:        [38:05] I think we all have similar depths. You kind of look for 60 feet. That's kind of the goal.  But I think it's just the difference in the water temperature. I mean, in the winter, the water temperature here is like in the low 40s.  And then in the summer – like right now is probably one of the warmest times the year for the water.  And it's like maybe 60.  And I don't know what they're seeing in Midcoast, but I know in Portland it's more like 70.  And I think that makes a big difference.


Q:        [38:40] And then, yeah, so that's interesting.  So it's mostly seaweeds.  How often do you have to clean your gear to get that off and what does that look like?  They bring it back to shore.  I think I see them at the power wash. 


A:        [38:52] Yeah.  Yeah.  I have power washed my nets.  If I put them in the water, say in like September, I'll power wash them in the spring. And they're really not that dirty after spending the winter because there's just not a lot going on in the water when the water's so cold.  And then I'll probably need to power wash them again sometime mid-summer because then it to the growth just like is exponential with like kelp and everything.  But it's mostly like twice a year for now.


Q:        [39:26] And then the scallop itself.  Is it getting biofouled?  And do you have to remove that?


A:        [39:34] Yeah, they get some biofouling.  I mean, the more I do my stocking density, the less biofouling I get, but I don't get to do it as much as I should.  So I definitely am getting more like – I actually don't even really know what they are, but they're similar to sea squirts, but I know they're not sea squirts.  And they grow on the scallops and I'll just peel them off when I am doing stocking density, but I haven't noticed anything too crazy if I don't wait too long to sort.  So.


Q:        [40:15] And when you say stocking density, you mean as they grow, sort of need to be a lower density on – 


A:        [40:21] Yeah, because I'll originally stock them when they're babies, like 500 scallops per net. And then I go all the way down to 20.  And then from 20 I go to 10.  And then once I'm at 10, they're close to market size.  And if I want to keep growing them to be the full-grown size, I'll do five per net.  Yeah.  


Q:        [40:45] And so it seems like the main kind of impact just in your life out here is on the infrastructure and the kind of risk of storms.  


A:        [40:55] Yeah.


Q:        [40:57] Is there anything else you can think of that you want to mention in terms of kind of changes in the marine environment you've noticed in your life out here kind of in your fishing career?


A:        [41:06] Yeah, I mean, I have like worries.  It's not things that I've noticed yet.  I mean, I definitely worry about like the general population of lobster just continuing to move north.  I mean, we've seen it happening.  I mean, Long Island use to be a great place to lobster.  Now there's like no lobster in there.  And then Massachusetts.  And there's even less lobster in there now.  And even now Southern Maine we're starting to see like a big decrease in numbers.


        So it's just it kind of feels like it's a matter of time, but I'm just hoping that it's slower than we think.  And then sea scallops are temperamental and they have certain temperatures that they thrive in.  And then once it hits a certain temperature, they're not happy anymore.  


        So I think at least where I'm located on the coast, I'll have a lot more time than say somebody in Southern Maine would.  Yeah.


Q:        [42:17] But you're just concerned about that uncertainty for the future for capture fishing and I guess pretty diverse stuff in the scallop farm (inaudible).


A:        [42:29] Yeah, yeah.


Q:        [42:30] Yeah.  So as you kind of mentioned, everyone in like every household out here seemingly has a tie to the co-op elite.


A:        [42:38] Pretty much.  Yeah.


Q:        [42:43] Yeah.  Are – is there anything you feel – I mean, we don't have as many examples it seems like, which is great, of things personally impacting you and your work in the sector as much, but I guess just to ask the question.  


        Do you have anything that you'd like to try or that you've been able to try to kind of help adapt to kind of cope to the chain cope with the changes that are happening out here?


A:        [43:09] I mean, I haven't been experiencing any changes that are directly like I need to do something to combat this within my work.  I mean, that's definitely something that I think will come up like the idea of water temperature warming like maybe that means I'm going to have to start growing scallops and bottom cages eventually because the water's colder down there, you know.


        But, as of right now, I don't feel like I'm at that place yet, but it's definitely in the back of my mind thinking about like, how I’m going to adapt to these changes when they come.  So.


Q:        [43:52] Relatively, and maybe you want to repeat something you've already mentioned earlier, but to pose the question, kind of what is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future of Maine coastal fisheries and aquaculture industry?


A:        [44:05] I mean, yeah, that's a big question.  I think the hardest part is – I mean, obviously it's just like devastating for the environment if all of these like things that make Maine, Maine are just like gone.  But I also just think it's really devastating for the people who do it.  


        I think like a lot of people have jobs that are just jobs and it's like, you know, they do – they make ends meet and that's that.  But I don't really know any lobstermen that aren't like lobstermen to the core.  Like that is what they are.  It's not their job.  It's what they do.  Like it's who they are.  


        And I think that Maine could, at least the coast, could see a really massive depression.  I mean, it's just financially and just personally, there's so many people that are affected by the fishery and I just – I personally can't picture life without it, because it's just been such a big part of my life, and my family's life, and everybody on the island and everybody on the coast.  


        So yeah, I just think it would be devastating if we didn't have the fishery.  And I think a lot of the law instrument are not sure what's going to get them first, the regulations or the environmental factors.  So it just kind of feels like very –  everything feels very uncertain.  Yeah.


Q:        [45:45] And if you could tell policymakers in Maine what some of the biggest priorities should be to kind of help people kind of adapt to and cope with these changes that are maybe coming.  What would you tell them?


A:        [46:02] I was to tell policymakers.  I don't – I mean, I don’t know.  I don't know what I would tell them.  I just – I feel like the researcher, the science – lobster scientists at the DMR, I think do a really good job and they are very focused on keeping the population healthy.  And I think that I have no problems with – with the science that they're presenting.  It just feels like a problem that is not even something a policymaker can do anything about.  


        It's like – yeah, I don't know.  I mean, if it's if we're talking just environmental factors, I – I don't know.  Yeah. 


Q:        [47:10] Big question.


A:        [47:11] Yeah.


Q:        [47:12] Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation – adaptation like trainings or programs for kind of fisheries or aquaculture? 


A:        [47:21] I haven't.  I was in talks with Island Institute for a little while about the possibility of an electric motor.  But when they described what they were thinking of and I described what I was going to need for infrastructure, it just didn't match up.  


        But I'm definitely really interested in making my – both of my businesses for lobstering and scallop farming as sustainable as possible.


        I was talking with a woman who grows mushroom buoys and was hoping to get some of those to test out.  And I'm hoping to incorporate some solar panels on my boat to run my hose, which is like basically all I use all day.  So instead of running my boat with the diesel engine, I could just use a solar pump.  


        And so, I'm not really directly involved with any, you know, nonprofits or anything like that.  But I definitely have personal changes that I'd like to make in my businesses that could make them greener.  


Q:        [48:30] Yeah.  And now I see kind of an the answer to this next question.  But what strategies do you think would be effective in building kind of resilience against kind of – kind of really impacts for fisheries or making fisheries kind of more sustainable?


A:        [48:44] Yeah, I – how do I want to say this.  I think there's two different types of fishermen. There's the smaller, closer in shore kind of fishing.  Less traps and – I'm trying to figure out the way I want to say this.  And then there's offshore, fishermen bigger boats, burning more diesel, buying more bait, you know, going through traps more quickly, going through boats more quickly.  


        I personally just, I mean, my uncle has owned the same Astro (sp?) for 50 years and it has done everything he's needed to do.  I'm not saying everybody has to do that, but I just think that there are certain approaches on how you can go about fishing where there's like, you can do everything you need to do to live comfortably or you can do the max amount.  


        And I just think that there's been like a slight change in the way people fish since like my dad was growing up.  People are more intense and, you know, flipping boats and, you know, fishing traps were two years and then buying new traps.  


        And I just think there are more sustainable ways to go about it. I mean, my dad's traps are sometimes all patches, which is a little much, but – but I just think that there are less wasteful ways to go about it that can make the fishery really sustainable.  But, yeah.


Q:        [50:40] I’m trying to think – that’s great, but – and how do you think maybe shifting to the aquaculture side, when you see the role of aquaculture, like scallops and other things like in that sort of picture of kind of climate resilience for the industry in the future?


A:        [50:54] Yeah, I mean – aquaculture, I kind of split it into two categories.  There's like the fin-fish aquaculture and then there's bivalve aquaculture.  And I would put kelp aquaculture in the same category.  


        But I think that bivalve aquaculture and, you know, any kind of sea vegetable aquaculture are net positives for the environment.  You're bringing in these creatures that can do incredible things.  You know, a scallop can filter 95 gallons of water a day and they sequester carbon to help strengthen their shells.  I mean, it's just like there's not a lot of proteins that you can grow or, you know, farm that are actually having a positive impact on the environment that they're in.


        So I think that's something that's really special about bivalve aquaculture.  You're never inputting any kind of feeder fertilizer into the water, which is amazing. They're just filtering off of – they’re filter feeding off of the water that is just naturally bare.  


        Yeah, I just – I don't see a lot of negatives with it, which, which is really great.  I mean, the only negative I can think of with my businesses, is like I burn a half gallon of diesel a day, which is like, I guess it could be none, but I think that's pretty good.  So.


Q:        [52:23] Great.  Thank you.  And we were kind of focusing on environmental changes, but are there any other types of changes that are like not environmental that you can think of that are impacting your work that you want to tell us about.


A:        [52:34] I mean, there's a lot of regulatory changes in the lobstering industry that have to do with different things.  Some – some are put in place to help protect the lobster population.  Like there's a measure change coming up that was just delayed from January to July.  So they're going to increase the minimum by a 16th of an inch, which sounds like it wouldn't make that big of a difference, but it's going to make a really big difference.


        I am not opposed to that.  It's just really going to change the way that people fish.  There essentially won't be much of a spring fishery, just because a lot of the lobsters that we catch in the spring are like jump before they shed.


        So that change is coming. We've had a lot of changes that we've had to make to our gear because of right whale regulations.  So we've had to implement weak links or breakaways in our ropes that break at 1700 pounds.  So if there's an entanglement, supposedly the rope will snap and it will help free the whale from the entanglement.


        I mean, I think a lot of us in the coast of Maine are struggling with all the right whale regulations because, I mean, I've seen plenty of whales.  I've never seen a right whale.  My dad has been fishing for 50 years.  He's never seen a right whale.  If you track like – if you go on the websites where they're tracking their migratory paths, they're going through the Gulf of Maine, but it's so much further offshore than the fishing grounds that it's just really hard to continue to spend the money, to modify gear, to buy different types of rope, to buy these weak links, and then spend the time inserting the weak links.


        And then they're talking about ropeless gear and – oh, the average lobster trap, just a normal lobster trap is close to $200 now. And then they – this ropeless gear would be more like $1,200 a trap.  It’s like – that tanks the business immediately, spending $1,200 on a trap.  You just can't do that. 


        And then there's just a bunch of factors with the ropeless gear that don't even logically make sense.  I think a lot of –  


        There's a big disconnect between the technology that's being designed and people who have actually spent time on the water lobstering.  So it’s – I think, between all of those regulations and then proposed windmill sites that are in like prime fishing grounds, it's just like there's a lot there that is threatening the fishery.  


Q:        [55:23] Are there things you or your dad, the license holder or your partner in his business like, have you guys been able to kind of cope with or adapt to those regulatory changes?  Or is it – fell like there’s not much you can do about it.


A:        [55:37] I mean, we just kind of have to do what they're telling us to do if we want to continue to fish.  And that's fine.  We've put weak links in all of our ropes and changed the way, you know, we've got to have sinking rope at the top and floating rope on the bottom.  And then in certain areas, you have to have sinking rope connecting each trap and then certain areas you need floating rope connecting each trap.


        So I think mostly lobstermen have just done what they've been told to do because if they don't, then they lose their license.  And it's like, well, you have no option then you have to do what you're being told to do.  I think the vertical line reductions that have been proposed.  If – if what they're proposing actually goes through, but yeah, that'll be a huge change for fishermen.


        And I don't see how it's possible for all the people who have licenses to continue fishing if the reductions that they want to take are in place.  


Q:        [56:45] And shifting gears a little bit.  Have you noticed any like positive changes or opportunities that you've noticed or experienced in the fisheries or aquaculture industry over time?


A:        [56:57] I mean, in the aquaculture industry, the scallop farming is so new people are super excited about it, which is awesome.  It's like, oh, I can have fresh scallops in the summer now.  Like that's never happened before.  So that's really exciting.  And it's just kind of a different product than the wild caught scallops because they're – you can harvest the petites, which I really like.  And that's what I'd like to focus on. 


        So there's a lot of opportunity with the scallop aquaculture, I think.  And people are just, I'm really happy with the responses I've gotten about it.  


        Lobster industry.  I mean, I have not noticed a big downturn.  To me, that's positive.  (laughter)  Any year where we're still doing what we've been doing for the last five years, that's great.  I'm just happy that things have kind of stayed where they have been at.  I don't think that's true for the rest of the coast, but I think Southern Maine is not seeing that.  


        But I am hoping that the size of the business I plan to have lobstering is just small enough that if things do go south in the next 10 years, I'll have it paid off and it'll be OK.  And I'll have to pivot into something else.  But yeah.


Q:        [58:25] And then we've kind of talked about this maybe a little bit earlier, but have you noticed any changes in women's presence, participation or status in fisheries, meaning both captured fishing and aquaculture over time?


A:        [58:38] Yeah, I mean, growing up out here, there was one woman captain who was a member of the co-op, and – but she was the only one.  And every once in a while, my dad would have a woman work on the boat with him, and you'd see a woman at the co-op on the stern every once in a while.  And now it seems like every summer there's at least two female sternmen at the co-op, which is really cool to see.  


        And I'm meeting a lot more people on Mount Desert Island who are also sterning, or in a similar situation to me where they're on a wait list waiting to get their license.  


        So I just hope that – I hope that all these women get the opportunity to do what all these guys have been doing forever.  I mean, my dad just had to pay a hundred bucks and he got a license.  That was it.  I mean, he didn't have to wait or do anything.  You know?  So I just hope that we'll get that opportunity too.  So.


Q:        [59:39] And then in terms of aquaculture, you kind of mentioned this earlier, just the rates. It looks different (inaudible; overlapping dialogue).


A:        [59:47] Yeah, yeah.  I mean, a lot of the people I know who have – well, mostly oyster farms, because I mostly see oyster farms, are women, which is really cool.  I don't know what the exact statistics are, but I know it's much closer to 50/50 than lobstering is.  


        And then I think it's cool.  Like a lot of the women I know who have oyster farms have all female crews too, which is really cool.  


        Because I just don't think that women are really encouraged to work on the water.  So I don't even think it's like something – at least for me, it was like not even something I thought about.  And I'm surrounded by it.  I just didn't have the – I mean, my dad would take me out to haul my five traps, but it was more of like, you know, we're – I was a kid and we were doing this thing together.  


        But I think a lot of sons of fishermen are like, yeah, let's get you a boat and let's get you traps.  And let's really try and do the student program, whereas I don't think that the daughters of fishermen are getting that same kind of like, yeah, let's do this thing.  


        And so I just think that when you're not, you know, seeing examples of women on the water, it's not even a thought, because I didn't even think about it.  


Q:        [1:01:08] Yeah, I just think about what other like, peers of yours, or young women you knew growing up, like, yeah, do you think a lot of women didn't go into it, like you haven’t (inaudible) or – 


A:        [1:01:18] Yeah, I mean, I went to high school with a lot of girls whose parents – whose fathers were fishermen, and a couple of them did go into it.  But I just – it's such a like, father-to-son thing that – I mean, I think if I had expressed more interest as like an eight-year-old, maybe my dad would have been more like, yeah, let's get you a boat and 50 traps.  But it was – I was not that interested at the time and just didn't see that for myself.  So.


        I think just when I see other women out there, it just makes me feel like, all right, cool.  We're getting this done, like, it's not just a couple of us anymore.  There's a lot more of us now.  So, yeah.  


        And a lot of the captains have said, way more reliable, works way harder, talks back a lot less.  So – (laughter)


Q:        [1:02:18] Really?


A:        [1:02:19] Yeah.  


Q:        [1:02:21] Wow, I've heard that one yet.


A:        [1:02:23] Yeah.


Q:        [1:02:25] And our last question for you is, what is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine coastal fisheries and aquaculture.


A:        [1:02:32] I mean, I just really hope that if we can keep fishing, I hope that all the lobster men are able to see, you know, from the perspective of the lobster scientists and the perspective of the lobster men combined, that we need to preserve the population and save it for future generations.  


        And we also need to be more mindful of what we're doing, day to day, to make our operations greener.  And I really hope that the fishery can continue indefinitely.  I mean, that's a very hopeful vision.


        And then with the aquaculture industry, I think that we're just going to see it boom.  I think there's just going to be a huge uptick in aquaculture.  I think that's just kind of inevitable with the wild populations doing their thing naturally.  I think that aquaculture is just going to explode, which is good too.  But it's not just like an inverse relationship where they're – yeah.


Q:        [1:03:49] And do you think those can be sort of in partnership or could be sort of in tension with each other, or – 


A:        [1:03:55] Yeah, I haven't talked to any scallopers, the wild fishering scallopers, really about what their thoughts are on it.  I guess I could see it being in competition, but there's going to be many, many years until it's in competition.  (laughter)  It’s like – this many, you know, so few scallops farmed that are available for harvest and way, way, way more wild caught.  And they're a lot cheaper wild caught than they are farmed.  So, yeah.  


Q:        [1:04:26] Is there, lastly, just, is there anything else you wanted to share with us on this interview?


A:        [1:04:31] I don't think so.  No.


END OF FILE"
"12","Q:        [0:00] How do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:05] Joanna Fogg, Owner and Operator of Bar Harbor Oyster Company.


Q:        [0:11] Awesome.  Tell me about where you grew up.


A:        [0:14] I grew up here on Mount Desert Island.  I was born and raised here, and I have spent most of my life here.  I've traveled a fair bit, but this is where I grew up, and I have been really grateful that I did grow up here.  I'm also fortunate that I'm raising my daughter here as well.  


Q:        [0:31] That's awesome.  Are your parents from here too? 


A:        [0:34] Yes, my father is from here, and my mother moved here right after college.  She met my father at Bates and moved here after graduating.  


Q:        [0:46] Got you.  What's their background like? 


A:        [0:49] Their work background or their – my mom actually worked as a postmaster in Seal Harbor for years.  She worked at a laundromat that she co-owned.  She cleaned a lot of summer houses.  My dad was a regional salesman for a plumbing company.  He traveled a lot for that.


Q:        [1:14] Got you.  So, no familial background in fisheries?


A:        [1:17] No.  


Q:        [1:18] Do you have any siblings?


A:        [1:20] I do.  I have an older brother and an older sister and four stepsisters.  My brother is a mariner.  He went to my Maine Maritime, and he ships out on oil tankers now.


Q:        [1:32] Wow.  Do you have a history of fishing in your family aside from –


A:        [1:38] Not fishing.  No.  I have mariners, yeah.  I have a grandfather who – the Navy and who also went to Maine Maritime, but not in fisheries or aquaculture.


Q:        [1:49] Got you.  Are you married?


A:        [1:51] Yes.


Q:        [1:52] Do you have any children? 


A:        [1:53] Yes.  I have one daughter.


Q:        [1:54] How old is she?


A:        [1:56] Seven.


Q:        [1:57] Do you want your children to go into fishing when they grow up?


A:        [2:01] If she wants to, I hope so.  I hope she's interested in aquaculture.  Yeah.


Q:        [2:05] Do you bring her out on the water with you?


A:        [2:07] Yes. (laughter) Sometimes, reluctantly.  She actually has gone out since she was really, really little.  Her car seat would fit in a fish tray, and I would go out and put her in a fish tray and put her on the boat with an umbrella over her or under the worktable while I was working alone, and I would breastfeed her out there.  Or if it was a day that I had childcare and didn't have to bring her, I would bring my pump out there.  It was one thing that made having my own farm conducive to being a mom because I could actually do all of that.


Q:        [20:42] Does she have any friends that she can relate to that experience with?


A:        [20:46] I don’t know any – not that I know of.  Not that I know of. We're the only sea farmers that have kids that age, anyway, that I know of around here in the area, so I don't think so.  At this point, she prefers – she likes doing delivery now more so than she likes being on the water.  She likes to sit in the front seat of the reefer truck and go into restaurants, deliver oysters, and buy oysters.  We buy oysters from some other small farms, so she likes to go and do that bit.  She might be on sales someday.  We'll see.  


Q:        [3:22] That's awesome.  


A:        [3:23] Yeah, yeah. (laughter)


Q:        [3:24] How would you describe your role in the aquaculture industry in Maine?


A:        [3:29] Wow.  My main role is that I am running a relatively successful company.  It's taken us a while to get off the ground, but I'm instrumental in supplying seafood, fresh local seafood, to the island, but I also spend a fair amount of time doing outreach.  I'm on the board of the Maine Aquaculture Association, so I'm pretty involved in what's happening in the legislature and how different things affect sea farmers across the state and promoting that.  I'm always willing to take time to work with school groups and give interviews and things like that because I do believe that this sector is really important to the sustainability of our people and food.  On the entire eastern seaboard, I think that sea farming is really important as far as providing the protein that we're going to need, particularly on a planet that is seeing some pretty rapid climate change.  I dedicate a lot of my time to putting energy into that and trying to educate myself and educate other people and collaborating on those issues.  Then, I also get to be a mom. (laughter)


Q:        [4:42] So, a very active role.


A:        [4:44] Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  I'm not doing it to get rich because I don't think that will ever happen. (laughter)


Q:        [4:50] How did you get into this? 


A:        [4:53] Well, like I said, I grew up on the island.  I did work in wild fisheries, so I worked on lobster boats for about seven seasons.  Then I transitioned from that to work as a chef and mate on private yachts.  I've worked on boats predominantly in the Caribbean, but also in the Med and have done a couple of transatlantic deliveries.  I found myself in 2014 searching for boat work and often being away in the winters because there aren't many yachts here in the winter.  The climate's not conducive to that.  I was often traveling a lot, and so was my husband.  He's a chief engineer on a longliner in Alaska, so he grew up fishing and has also often been away for work.  He still ships out.  But in 2014, I was in the West Indies, working on boats, and he was in Alaska, and it was like, how are we ever going to A, possibly start a family and B, come home, but also maintain our livelihood of working on the water?  


We were worried about climate change and the future of the wild fisheries in Maine.  A lot of things had been overfished.  Lobstering is a closed industry, and we also projected that it might not have a great future with the water warming that it is.  So, started doing a little bit of research and talking to people and just came across oysters.  We knew nothing about it.  We started watching YouTube and figuring things out.  It was like, “Wow, it seems like with the way things are going, this could be a pretty viable resource in our waters, and it's something that we could probably do locally.”  


So around then, we just got some LPAs while we applied for a larger lease.  He continued to ship out, and I did also maintain a couple yachting jobs here as we started on those small things.  And then, in 2016, we got our standard lease, which is 22 acres.  At that time, it was a 10-year lease.  We just started growing into that.  It took us a while.  We started out small, like a lot of farms do.  We got literally maybe 12 cages and a couple handfuls of seed and just tried to figure it out – maintained our other jobs so we could fund things.  It takes three years for us to grow an oyster.  We didn't see even any income until 2017.


It just made sense for wanting to be able to do something that we cared about, and to maintain our livelihood working on the water, and to be home.  We care a lot about this island, and it feels like home.  There also aren't a lot of other food resources that are being grown locally, and millions of people come here every year – millions of people.  It just kind of fit, and we dove in.  We just gave it a shot. (laughter)


Q:        [7:49] Awesome.  What licenses – commercial licenses – do you hold?
  
A:        [7:56] Right now, I have my aquaculture license, my (inaudible) shippers license, and a lot of other small permits.  I have a couple limited permits and buying a station application, but I don't hold any commercial fisheries.  I do have my dealer's license and my aquaculture license. 


Q:        [8:13] Were there any barriers in getting that (inaudible)?


A:        [8:17] It's a long road to get a standard lease.  I mean, it took us – the leasing process is long and complicated.  I think the review process is longer than it should be.  I think there's a bit of a backlog, but it also makes sense that it is not necessarily an easy thing to get.  When you're sea farming, you're using public waters.  These are shared waters.  They don't belong to us.  It took us almost a year – granted, we were doing other things at the time – to have a complete application.  So, that’s a 60-page document to make sure that we're going to have – with your gear plan and your seeds, everything that you need to do to say, yes, we're serious about this, goes into the application, and then the state has to deem that complete.  There's a public scoping session and then a legal hearing.  


All of that took about a year, and then it was about two years for us to be granted permission to actually get that lease from the Department of Marine Resources and the Army Corps of Engineers.  It was about three years from when we started to want to be oyster farming to actually get that lease.  A lot of people can't wait that amount of time.  We were able to keep other jobs going.  Like I said, my husband still is – he still ships out about seven months out of the year.  It's a pretty big barrier to be able to have to wait that long.  There's a lot of capital that goes into it before you even sell a single oyster, and even more years before you maybe will turn a profit.  A lot of what I do is trying to figure out the right scale of our operations, what is economically sustainable, and what that size looks like. 


Q:        [10:01] Did you have any – were you mainly on your own at the beginning?


A:        [10:04] I do feel like we – I mean, there were a lot of things that we felt like we were able to do because we both have a history of working on the water.  There were a lot of skills that we were kind of able to transfer from our prior experience and our education that helped.  We definitely got help from other sea farmers.  So, Fiona is a good friend of mine, and she also owns a sea farm.  Hers was just a mussel farm at the start, but she was familiar with the leasing process.  A lot of sea farmers are just really collaborative and kind people, and generally, I have found this sector to be extremely collaborative.  We definitely talked to other sea farmers who kind of gave us some of the ins and outs of the system, helped us get ideas for what gear structures might work or may not work.  There was a lot of talking back and forth to different people about how to make it work.  I feel like we got a lot of help in that sense.  


Then, I also feel as though we got a fair amount of help from the DMR and a little bit from the harbormaster.  The process itself, when you're getting a lease, is somewhat interactive.  I think there's a statistic out there that it's like, oh, 99% of them go through, and I equate that to essentially a good college professor helping you get an A on an essay.  So, if we submit something and it's not quite right, or that doesn't seem like it's going to hold water, or there's an issue, then the state would be like, “Oh, well, you need this, or try this, or like, that isn't going to work,” and then you amend it, and then you amend it again until you get it right. (laughter) We did get some support from the people who are helping regulate that as far as what would be acceptable and what wouldn't be, so all of our original ideas weren't great, but then we modified and learned from that process and moved along.  But we definitely had help.  


Q:        [12:03] That’s great.  It sounds like it's a collaborative community.


A:        [12:07] It really feels like it is across the board, for sure.  Yeah.


Q:        [12:10] That’s great.  Do you have any experience in the industry beyond harvesting itself, for example, in bookkeeping, bait or gear preparation and post-harvest processing, marketing or trade, and advocacy or community-based organizations related to fisheries?


A:        [12:26] Yes. (laughter)


Q:        [12:27] (inaudible).


A:        [12:29] Yes, all of them.  Yeah, I'm all of those things.  I do my own books, do all my own invoicing.  We do all of our own sales, all of the client relations.  We build our own bags.  Gear work from start to finish.  The oysters that we put in are run through my hands at some point, (laughter) literally, and as far as the sales, and yeah, metaphorically.


Q:        [12:57] Awesome. What does an average day of work look like for you?


A:        [13:02] It depends a little bit on the season, and then I kind of try – I've found that my days are more productive if I don't try to do everything in one day, although often that doesn't happen.  In the summer – I'm naturally an early riser – I'm up by 4:30, usually.  I have my coffee.  I might be sending invoices or returning emails pertaining to sales or licensing or whatever committees or outreach and stuff that I'm involved in.  My crew shows up at my house to get the trucks and kind of make a plan at like eight o'clock in the morning.  We'll go over whether that day is going to be – whether we're flipping cages, whether we're harvesting, whether we're hand sorting oysters, culling them.  


Often, in the height of the season, we'll have two different – I'll have six employees, and so we've got three different boats.  One team might be working on one thing while another is doing something else.  Usually, my work involves being on one of our smaller boats with usually one or two other people and hand sorting.  I focus more on the end product because I'm also lining up the sales, and I have to have a good estimation of what is available so that I can then bring it to market.  We harvest and deliver two days a week.  Right now, we're at a scale where – summer – we're doing about 20,000 oysters a week.  We're doing a lot of culling them, rinsing them, bagging them, and then getting them ready so that we can just dump and go and deliver them the next day.  


Q:        [14:43] Wow, that's a lot of oysters.  


A:        [14:44] It is a lot of oysters.  Yeah.  It didn't start like that, but we're at that spot where I can still consider us a small farm, but we're also moving a fair amount of product.  We did over 400,000 oysters last year.  90-something percent of them stayed on MDI.  I'm not moving them any further than that.  We've got a small half-ton pickup truck that has a reefer unit on the back.  My biggest boat is 28 feet.  It's all small-scale stuff producing a fair amount of food.


Q:        [15:14] What's your team like?


A:        [15:16] It shifts a fair bit.  I have a couple of people who are full-time year-round.  My farm manager has currently worked for us for – I think this is his sixth season.  He grew up lobster fishing, and I think is drawn to this because it's a nice, steady, easy – it's not easy, but more even than fishing week would be.  It's been great to have him because his skills as a boater and his small boat handling and operations and know tying and gear work – his ability to just change the engine oil and troubleshoot things if we get breakdowns has been really helpful.  We have another woman who has also been with us for about that long.  Maybe this is her fifth season.  She only works seasonally because she likes to do scallop diving.  She drives a dive tender and likes to do some other stuff in the winter.  She has come a long way with us, and also handles the boats really well, and is just really steady.  


Then, everyone else that we have is pretty much seasonal, and that comes and goes depending on – usually, we have a lot of people who are part-time because they really want to work on the water.  But we also can't pay as much as even what you might make scooping ice cream downtown or waiting tables and things like that.  We have a lot of people who might work a few days a week for us, but then they also make money waiting tables or doing something else.  Those seasonal employees vary.  We have one who has come back – this is his third year, and he's our driver mainly.  He is also seasonal, but that's when most of our oysters move.  He is our delivery driver.  He's a slightly older employee who lives in North Carolina in the winter, and he's great at just like – he's meticulous with driving and has got good precision and mechanical skills and things like that.  So, yeah, we have a driver and then typically four or five other people on the farm on any given day.  


Q:        [17:24] Awesome.  That sounds like a good crew. (inaudible).


A:        [17:26] Yeah, we have a lot of fun people.  People come and go, but yeah, it can be a lot of fun.


Q:        [17:32] Awesome.  How do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing sector, including how others perceive you?


A:        [17:41] I think my background as a human ecologist helps me in a lot of ways because I have found running a small business, I have to wear a lot of different hats, and so I'm using a lot of different disciplines, essentially, and needing to understand how they connect and overlap in order to solve a lot of different problems.  My ability to network and communicate, I think, has been huge.  There are a lot of times when a lot of things might break down, or I'll have issues, and I won't actually know how to fix it, but being able to get the right people to help me or learn how to fix things is essential to my success as a businesswoman.  


         But yeah, that whole interdisciplinary – I mean, I will really someday be testifying at a hearing in Augusta one day and then scrubbing mud off of something and painting the bottom of my boat the next day.  There's this huge range of things that I do, which having a pretty interdisciplinary background has certainly prepared me for that.  Some days, it's overwhelming, but I also think I'd be bored without it. (laughter) The fact that I never know what hat I might be putting on and how my day-to-day can look pretty different makes it really stimulating for me and is often invigorating and exciting.


Q:        [19:03] I like what you said about – there's sometimes you don't know how to fix something, but you know how to find the avenue to find help for that.


A:        [19:12] It's so much of what it is.  Yeah.  Last week, seriously, my reefer truck broke down, my ice maker broke down, and our hauler broke.  And it was like, “I am not” – my husband is a marine engineer, and, of course, he was in Alaska.  And I'm like, “I don't know how to fix any of this stuff.  This is not my wheelhouse.”  But I had a client who knew about ice makers, and he wanted to be able to make it work because he wants our product.  


The fact that – just getting on the phone with the right people – and I think also having some transparency about what I do – I'm a businesswoman, but I also am very transparent.  I think there's some kind of – I’m not out to make a million dollars.  I want this to work.  I think there is something about putting that good energy out there and just trusting that I’m going to bring you good food at a fair price, and that comes back.  I've got nothing to hide as far as what I do.  It's a very honest business.  


So, if I need help, most people are inclined to help because they want to see us succeed.  I think they also know that if they had an issue, I would help them if I could.  There’s that kind of reciprocity that just seems to work out in sea farming with other farmers and with the people who are buying your product.  We like knowing where our food comes from, and we like seeing small, sustainable businesses succeed.  I have faith in that.  I have some trust in that system most days. (laughter) Most days.


Q:        [20:47] Absolutely.  That feels really genuine (inaudible).  How does your role in the fishing – how does your role in the fishing sector work with your family or caregiving responsibilities?


A:        [20:59] A lot of it can really be day by day.  The fact that I'm the owner of my own company gives me a little bit of leeway in some ways.  So, I can, for example, drive myself in on my own boat and be there to pick up my daughter when she gets off the bus.  Because I'm the boss, and I can do that.  There are other times when it can be more of an infringement because when shit breaks loose, it's also like, the buck stops at me.  So, there will be times when I can't parent the same way I'd want to.  I can't finish the bedtime story because I've got to respond to a client or there's some issue with HR.  I have an employee who has an issue that I have to deal with or something like that.  So, there are a lot of times when it can benefit me, and then there are some drawbacks because, ultimately, all of the responsibility is on me as the owner and the operator.  It's a little bit back and forth.  I feel like, overall, I have more freedom as the owner and operator of the company because I can, when possible, delegate what I need to so that I can also be a full-time mom because that's my first job.


Q:        [22:15] I'm going to switch over to more environmental questions.  Can you describe any changes in the marine environment you notice?


A:        [22:23] Definitely.  I'm sure you've heard it.  Overall, it's getting warmer.  Sea temps are getting warmer.  We knew this in 2014 as we started sea farming.  It was part of the reason we got into it was just – we were afraid that other fisheries weren't going to do as well as the sea temps started to warm up, and so we are seeing an overall average of increasing sea temperatures.  That's nothing new.  With that comes, well, new bacterias and also new species or a prevalence of native species that we haven't seen.  If there are things that are more likely to like warmer climates, we're seeing more of those.  


I think probably the levels of biofouling on our gear have increased, as well as some other species, different tunicates, and things that we weren't seeing as much earlier on, and we see more of now because they're thriving more in the warmer sea temps.  More irregular weather than I remember here growing up.  So, more big, big storms.  I feel like we've seen more of that.  Thankfully for us, it hasn't caused any real damage to our gear because we sink things.  


Longer growing season.  So, overall, our growing season is longer, which, in general, comes as a benefit to us, but less ice pack.  I think, in my lifetime, we will get to a point where we don't have to sink our cages due to the ice.  I think that we'll get there if I continue this for another couple of decades.  I think that we will we'll end up having a two-year instead of a three-year oyster because they will be growing that much longer.  So, we'll have a product that we can bring to market in less amount of time because they'll be growing more.  I don't know exactly what else will come with that.  I mean, that sounds like a good thing economically for me if it costs me a lot less money to grow a two-year oyster than a three-year oyster.  But we may see some other things that come with that that don't make that easy, and there may be some other challenges.  I'm not a scientist, so there are some things I may be like an ostrich and put my head in the sand.  I’m like, “I don't want to necessarily know what's coming down the road.”  I do, but yeah, I think we'll see some challenges that I don't even really know yet come with that.  


Q:        [24:47] Got you.  What are some of the ways this has already begun to impact your work?


A:        [24:53] So, having a longer growing season is better for us in many ways because, like I said, if I can bring an oyster to market sooner, it costs me less money, so that could be huge.  The most recent thing that's at the forefront now has been the Vibrio control plan that's rolling out across the state of Maine.  It started on June 1st.  You guys probably heard a fair bit about this, but that has been at the forefront of my mind as a grower and a harvester is how we've had to change our process as a result of that.  I think that is completely climate change-driven.  


Vibrio is a bacteria, naturally occurring bacteria, that's in the water.  It starts to thrive and reproduce at 65 degrees.  When we see sea temps of that regularly, we know that we could have a prevalence of that in the water.  If it's consumed at high levels by people, those people can get sick.  Now we're ice plunging all of our oysters when we harvest them, and that adds a lot of time, which is expense for us, as well as having to buy the equipment to produce that ice and to move that ice, and then the time temperature controls and the logging that's required.  That's the biggest shift right now that we're kind of facing in regards to having to deal with climate change, is all of the added cost and work that is going into something that I do see as climate change driven.


Q:        [26:24] Have you had to make any changes to your gear?


A:        [26:27] We have not had to make changes to our gear due to climate.  No.  We still continue to sink all of our cages in the winter.  We've done some modification of anchors, but that wasn't really climate change.  We haven't changed our gear for this.  For the Vibrio, we had to buy a large flake ice machine, as well as some Xactic tubs to ice plunge our oysters in.  But we haven't changed our gear plan or our gear layout because of it.


Q:        [27:03] Looking forward to the future and thinking about adaptations that you have to make, are there any resources, relationships, knowledge, training, or organizations that you're drawing from to respond?


A:        [27:16] Can you repeat the question?


Q:        [27:18] In relation to adaptations you’ll have to make in the future, are there any resources, relationships, knowledge, training, or organizations that you’ll draw from to respond?


A:        [27:29] There may be a need for things like crop insurance depending on what the changes are.  I think there are a lot of unforeseen changes right now that can come down the line.  I think, for me, as an environmentalist, some things that I want to see are gear structures that are either repurposed, recycled, or are more sustainable.  Right now, all the pontoons on all 850 cages that I have are all plastic, and there's no good method for actually repurposing that or recycling that plastic.  The pontoons are expensive, and I think that we need – I think there needs to be a better system for that.  I think there are organizations that can help with that.  


Also, one thing I'm wary of – not sure it is climate driven, but microplastics in the water.  Right now, we don't have any regulations around that, but I know that there have to be some level of microplastics in our water.  And oysters are very much the water.  We eat what they eat, and they are what they eat.  That's one thing that I think we may need to get some support with down the road.  As that changes, how can we adapt?  Are these levels going to be safe for us?  What are the levels?  And how can we make sure that’s not an issue with our product?  Because I've built a company on raising seafood that is really good for you, but if we aren't sure exactly what's in them when it comes to microplastics, then we're going to have to adapt.  I think that could be a huge thing.  


For us locally, and I think it's an issue in other areas, one of the changes that I think is happening is – well, it's a gentrification of the coastline, which is, in part, part of climate change.  People want to move to the coast if they can afford to, buy their second, their third, their fourth, whatever house is, or retire along the coast of Maine because it's beautiful and it's cooler than a lot of other places, which means for us, we have a very hard time finding housing.  


So, I am currently in the process of trying to put up employee housing for at least a farm manager.  But it is really a crunch.  I have a lot of people who want to apply in the spring.  They are anxious.  They are eager to work on an oyster farm.  They love the idea of it.  They're willing to work for what I'm willing to pay them.  But they can’t find housing.  I think as we see more and more temperature is rising and sea level rising, we're going to find that there is a cramp on our land, and that is going to affect the working waterfront and the people who are engaged in that community and housing for them.  I think that's another big thing that we're going to have to adapt to, is finding affordable housing for people who are going to live on farm wages.  Coastal housing for people who live on farm wages.  There's an issue there.  There's a little bit of a disconnect, a rift, right now, and I'm very much in the throes of it because I need employees, and they need houses.


Q:        [30:48] And they all don’t fit in your house probably.


A:        [30:50] Sometimes, it seems like they would, but no, they don't. (laughter) There's enough stuff happening at my house.


Q:        [30:56] To expand on the working waterfront topic, do you have any trouble accessing your farm?


A:        [31:02] Not currently.  We're grateful.  We use Hadley Point as an access.  We keep our boats there and our moorings there.  Thankfully, it's only a few miles from where I live, and there was just – yeah.  I know that is an issue for a lot of people.  We're lucky that we have a public place to keep our boats.  We pay mooring fees, which are affordable.  There aren't that many other commercial fisheries happening there because it's not a deep-water port, so we're not competing with lobstermen or other things like that because it's such a tidal area, there's no dock, which, at times, is a pain.  There's no way nearby for us to get fuel and things like that.  It’s not easy for us to load or unload things.  But because it's not easy for that to happen, there's not as much commercial traffic, so it kind of works for us.  At this point, it's worthwhile.  It works.  I just have small, flat-bottom boats. (laughter) 


Yeah, it would be great if there were some more infrastructure so that I would – I still fuel up all of our boats by putting multiple five-gallon cans in the back of my truck, going to fill them up at a gas station and then bringing them down and then pulling them out.  It’s a pain, but I can't complain because I do have access.


Q:        [32:29] What is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future of Maine's coastal fisheries and aquaculture industries?


A:        [32:38] I think I've already hit on a couple of them.  As we see the ocean warming, I think we will see – with warming oceans comes ocean acidification, and I think it could be less hospitable for oysters and all of the ecosystem.  I do worry a little bit about that, and I'm also concerned about microplastics and how that's going to go.  I know Vibrio has existed in our waters for a long time, and I think that we've got that under control, but what's going to be the next thing?  I don't know.  I think some of the things that I'm most worried about are things that I don't know yet, the unknown things that we don't have the data (sp?) on to prepare for.  I think that's part of it.


Q:        [33:29] If you could tell policymakers in Maine what the biggest priorities should be to help people adapt to this, what would you tell them?


A:        [33:37] I think some of the biggest issues now facing the working waterfront are our housing and that issue and also being able to get low-interest loans.  So many crops in this country are subsidized, and a lot of those crops end up going to be feed for other crops that it actually isn’t the smartest way to use our money.  If there is going to be funding or low-interest loans or subsidies for crops, I think that things in aquaculture make more sense.  I mean, we don't need any fresh water.  We aren't feeding things to other things.  The amount of resources that go into sea farming to get a certain amount of protein and nutritional value are so low comparatively to any land-based protein.  


What we need is money. (laughter) I want systems that are going to help us, like low-interest loans.  Get us gear.  Get us ways to recycle gear.  Get us housing so that we can actually be doing something.  Help us keep our waters clean.  Let's get more efficient testing out there.  What are the microplastics?  What are the Vibrio levels?  Let's just get some more resources to actually figure out how our water quality is and allow us to work it in ways that aren't strapping us financially.  There would be no way for us to have started our business if my husband hadn't been funding us through commercial fishing in Alaska seven months out of the year or taking out loans.  


We're in the process of getting a loan to start our housing project, and the interest rate is crazy.  I’m strapping myself to do part of a housing project because I can't afford to do all of it, but I also know that I can't afford to run a company without employees who have housing, so I'm in this crux of damned if I do, damned if I don't.  The federal government can help with that.  It can make it easier for us to get ahead so that we can actually be producing food.  I think that being able to harvest a diverse amount of things from our coastline is really important.  I don't think that we can rely on a monoculture of fishing, just lobsters or anything.  I think that we have to be able to have a diverse harvest or catch so that we're resilient and so that we're supporting a diverse ecosystem of things.  I think there's not as much attention on that as there could be, and we could use some support in that.


Q:        [36:27] Thank you.  Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training or programs for the fishing industry or aquaculture?


A:        [36:38] Not formally, no.


Q:        [36:40] OK.  What strategies do you think would be effective in building resilience against climate-related impacts?


A:        [36:48] We currently don't have crop insurance.  A lot of it doesn't even cover stuff that we would be able to have.  I think having good networks for shipping products during times of either feast or famine could help move product when we needed to or reserve product when we needed to.  I think just more emphasis on water quality, and what is coming down the line with that.  


Also, there's so much that goes into the – I mean, we don't face it so much because almost 90-something percent of our product stays right here on the island, so we're hyper-local.  But when you're talking about moving, essentially, oysters, mussels, live animals, there's so much that goes into refrigeration and that cold bit.  I think we could use more technologies that are allowing us to – the packaging being greener.  


I mean, right now, all of my stuff is moved in plastic mesh bags.  There are other avenues for less plasticky plastic bags and things that are like that, but it's not scalable and it's super expensive.  If I’m going to do that, like, I don't know if I can afford to switch to a greener bag.  I'd like to see that roll out at a cost that's equivalent to something else and systems that can make it just greener across the whole board.  I could have a solar-powered tumbler if I could afford the solar panels and the batteries to run my generator.  But that's going to set me back like 10 grand that I don't have right now.  We could make this a lot greener if we had the technology and the funds for it.


Q:        [39:48] Are there other types of changes, not only environmental, that are impacting your work you want to tell us about?


A:        [38:55] I think the market demand for oysters.  Outside of the environment, I think people's consumption of different foods is starting to change, and people vote with their dollars.  I think that as we see more pressure on other land-based proteins, people are going to start to rely more on seafood.  I mean that that trend has been going for at least a decade.  People are eating more seafood.  Doctors are saying it's healthier to eat seafood.  I think people are starting to realize that the actual cost of a hamburger is.  


So, those other types of proteins – I think, we're going to start to see a larger demand for oysters, and that Maine oysters are going to start to take up a larger share of the existing market because Maine oysters are the best. (laughter) People are starting to discover that.  I think those shifts are happening, and so being able to keep up with that demand and keep it as green as possible throughout the shipping channels is happening.  I'm not worried about market saturation.  I'm worried about getting as much as what my oyster actually costs and is worth, but I think that we're going to see more and more people eating seafood and probably bivalve because they're cleaning up the ocean. 


Even people who are less likely to eat meat for possibly humanitarian reasons are maybe opening up their minds to that, or changing their ideas about that, because eating locally has such a – I think people sometimes weigh – “OK, I don't want to eat meat because it's maybe bad for the planet, or because I don't want to hurt an animal.  But if I can eat a bivalve that doesn't have a brain or a central nervous system, and it was harvested right here, maybe that's actually the smarter choice for the planet.”  I'm here to tell you it is and to encourage that.  I think that we're going to start to see more of that shift, especially as the lands get drier and hotter, and it's harder to make protein and things on Earth.


Q:        [41:15] Sounds like a no-brainer.  


A:        [41:16] (laughter)


Q:        [41:18] Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes you've experienced in the industry during your time?


A:        [41:24] Yeah.  There have been different things that are coming up.  I am excited.  I am about to apply for a grant from the USDA, which is a low interest loan over a long term for employee housing.  I'm not sure if I'll get it, but I feel like that's maybe an option.  Things kind of open up in small ways.  Nothing really big is coming up.  I feel like there are a lot of moments when there's this clearing, and a sunbeam comes down, and it's happening.  There are times when opportunities are there.  I think I've had a lot of interactions with youth, in particular.  I love working with younger people who are interested in farming when kind of the a-ha moment is like, “Oh, this is what a sea farm is.  This is what it looks like to be a sea farmer.”  And it becomes an opportunity because it's becoming real in a young person's mind that it’s a thing.  


So many of us – we know what farming looks like, and we place your silos and pigs, and we romanticize about that.  Every kid, particularly on coastal Maine, knows what fishing is and what lobstering is.  But as a sea farmer, there are very few people who actually know who we are, what we do, what it looks like to be a sea farmer.  Every time I have a chance to engage with someone new on that and give them a window into our world, it’s really validating and really rewarding because we become real, and we get to be established again and again.  


I feel like the most opportunity I feel like is happening to the sector is when I work with young people who are like, “Oh, I want to be a sea farmer.  We’re going on a boat now?  OK.”  And that idea that we're neither exactly farm nor fisheries or really, that we're both and that connection between land and sea becomes real in someone's mind, is an opportunity for me.  I'm like, “OK, there could be a future here.  This could happen.” (laughter) You come up with the ideas to fix this, and I'll give you a job as soon as you can reach my worktable.  (laughter)


Q:        [43:45] That’s awesome.  Have you had any opportunities to go into your daughter's school and share the work you do?


A:        [43:55] Not with her class directly.  I do have school groups, some that have come out to the farm directly, although that's hard because we only have small boats, and there's liability and stuff.  But I do work – I'll meet school groups at Hadley Point and bring as much of our farm to them as we can.  So, bring our gear, bring different size oysters, bring the tools that we use on the boat.  We do have at least a few school groups a year that come to do that part.  They get to see what we're doing and get an idea of what it's like to be out on the farm and what aquaculture looks like.  


My daughter is some – I've had some of my daughter's friends out, and she, of course, is out on the water a fair bit, which is nice.  She did say when – she filled out her “I want to be a,” and she wrote oyster farmer last year on her first day of kindergarten. I was like, “Oh, this is good.”  I was like, “Yes.”  Her teacher didn't know that I owned and operated an oyster farm.  And she's like, “I'd never seen anyone answer that before.”  Then, months later, she figured out why. (laughter) But yeah, that was gratifying.  


Q:        [45:00] That's awesome.  Do you feel like your gender has played any kind of role in your job?


A:        [45:06] To some extent.  I can only see it within the world that I know it, which has been female my whole life.  I think because I see it as a really collaborative industry, and I associate being collaborative and communicating a lot as feminine traits, it plays into that.  It also plays into a lot, I think – that whole multitasking bit.  At any given point, there are eight different things going on (laughter), maybe more.  I think that is something that women evolved to do because, in general, we were the ones that were taking care of kids and doing all these other things.  So, running a small company, whether it's a sea farm or any company, I think you're always going to be faced with multitasking.  I think that is something that I am – and it's a strong suit because I think that it’s partly being female that I'm good at multitasking and good at collaborating and good and getting a lot of different pieces and moving parts to function in a day. (laughter) 


         I have some greeting cards I found that I now bought a stack of them and give it to everyone.  It says, “I'm just over here running a tight shipwreck.”  Some days, that's how it feels.  I'm just over here running a tight shipwreck because a lot of times it feels like I'm running around putting out fires.  But really, at the end of the day, it's working.  It's tight.  It's a tight shipwreck.


Q:        [46:37] That's awesome.  Do you feel like your role and presence in the community motivates other women or sets a pathway for people to see what opportunities are out there? 


A:        [46:45] Yes.  I make sure I hire a lot of women.  A lot of women do, I think, work or apply and want to work for us, I think in part because we have a pretty strong social media presence, and so they see a lot of women driving boats and working on boats, and feel like, “Oh, I can do that,” or are less intimidated to show up.  When I first started commercial fishing, I was like – I don't know.  There were probably at least 12 boats going out of the harbor.  If there's two people in every boat, that's 24 people.  I was one in 24.  I don't think that's the case in aquaculture.  I believe, currently, it still is only 15% of leaseholders are female, so we're still a minority.  But I sure as shit don't feel like a minority.  I definitely don't.  


Every woman or person who comes onto our farm and onto our boats learns how to drive the boat because A, it's empowering, and B, it's great for everybody to know how to do everything, especially – it's safer.  Everybody has to know how to drive a boat, so we work on that.  I do think that empowerment is contagious and uplifting.  Yeah.  It's important to me.  I love encouraging women to work on the water.


Q:        [48:04] It's awesome.  I'm fascinated by that a-ha moment of like, “Oh, I can do this.”  It’s demystifying (inaudible).


A:        [48:11] Yeah.  Giving people the opportunity to fail and to figure it out and to bump –thankfully, none of my boats are pretty, so I'm like, “You'll figure it out.  All right.  I'm not going to get mad if you ram the dock a little too hard the first time.  That's what it's going to take.”  I give people like freedom to fail and succeed until they succeed continuously.


Q:        [48:38] What is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's coastal fisheries


A:        [48:44] I hope that we can strengthen our working waterfront by giving people affordable housing and continue to harvest a diverse amount of species and products from the ocean and even broaden that.  I think that what we're harvesting isn't possibly as much as it could be as far as from a diverse standpoint.  So, increasing the number of species that we can sustainably harvest here, emboldening the working waterfront – I would love to be able to see some programs that also help small companies provide benefits.  


So, this is the first year I'm stretching myself to offer a stipend for health insurance for two of my employees.  It's strapping us a little bit, but they work hard.  We do manual labor around the clock, and we need health insurance.  Fishermen should have health insurance.  There are so many things that don't just come with the job but are so expensive.  I hope that there is some either collaborative buy-in or something so that we can actually get the right type of health care for our working waterfront.  I don't know of any programs where it's actually affordable to buy health care (laughter) for our families, which is just crazy.  


So, if the two people that I put on – I'm giving them a stipend for health insurance, which is like taxed when I give it to them.  I pay a tax on it, and they pay a tax on it, and then they have to go buy a plan on it.  That's not going to cover their families.  It's not going to cut – it's a sorry excuse for health insurance.  I think that we need to have a better system for taking care of our working waterfront.  These are the people who are supplying food.  We're feeding the tourists, we're feeding the communities, and we don't have a good health care system.  We're also doing some of the most manual labor.  It's backbreaking.  


That would be a hope of mine, as well as technologies that are going to make our work less demanding and greener.  If we can come up with better ways to flip cages, better ways to handle our gear, mechanisms for all of that, that is going to make it less physically demanding so that we can provide a safer working environment for the longevity of people's terms working.  That would be a hope of mine.  Yeah, this may be enough hopes for now.


M:        [51:18] Yeah.  I have a few questions, just things that I noticed and would love to follow up on.  Could you describe your educational background a little bit?  You mentioned being a human ecologist. 


A:        [51:29] Sure, yeah. I graduated from College of the Atlantic, so I have a BA in Human Ecology.  I traveled a bit.  I was a transfer student, so I traveled a bit, studied in Central America for a year, and went to Hampshire College for a year, but I graduated from COA.  I have a fair amount of – sternman on lobster boats, and then a fair bit of working passage on sailboats, and then private chefing on yachts.


M:        [51:57] How many years total Have you worked on the water?


A:        [52:01] I got my first job on a boat the summer I turned 17.  I was funding a backpacking trip around the world.  I'm not that old, but like 22 years. 


M:        [52:16] Wow.


A:        [52:17] Yeah.


M:        [52:18] If you don't mind me asking, what year were you born? 


A:        [52:20] ’84.  1984. 


M:        [52:22] I'm curious.  You talked a lot about looking towards the future and adaptation.  Are there any adaptations aside from the housing you're currently in the process of making?  You had mentioned biofouling.  I'm curious if you're addressing that in any way.


A:        [52:34] We are not currently addressing any other issues.  We've just kind of made it through the – just made it through the vibrio stuff in order to make that harvest happen with the housing bit.  We're putting up – it'll be employee housing, but we'll also have a farm stand and different location – office and space.  With biofouling, I'm just keeping an ear to the ground to systems, the cage flipping systems, that are happening.  I'm in the process of researching different types of bags for us to deliver our oysters in, so they might be greener as far as that goes.  But nothing else that we're directly working on now.


M:        [53:24] Then, my last question – I'm curious if you've been seeing green crabs.  We've heard that a lot from people who farm oysters, and I'm just curious your experience.


A:        [53:32] We see some of them.  For us, I don't think that's the main issue.  Green crabs rarely are able to get into our bags, and once they're on the surface, it's never an issue.  I think we've probably seen more dead loss, actually, from starfish in our bags.  But even that hasn't been bad for years.  As long as we sink our cages properly, in general, that's okay.  


Mostly for us, I think it's been a prevalence of tunicates, which are just more likely to thrive in warmer waters.  When those present themselves when you have a lot of tunicates on your bags and on your oysters, it adds so much weight to your gear, which is a lot harder to do, and it smothers them.  I like to clean that up.  Those can be issues.  And seagrasses.  All of this is just – a lot are native, but they're just growing to greater deals in warmer water.  Anything that is not an oyster is a weed in my garden.  The more weeds there are, the more work I have to do.  I think we're just going to contend more and more with that.  


And now, with the vibrio controls, we have to keep closer track of how long things are out of the water and when they go back in, so they're re-submerged for a long enough time for any potential vibrio levels to be low enough so that tracking system is going to have to change how we handle anything that is potentially market size.  So, yeah, changing those systems and that logging system so that we're all on the same page on the farm, and how we handle all of our product is – it's different.  We're busy trying to make sure we get that nailed down.


M:        [55:19] Yeah, great.  Those are all the questions I had.  


Q:        [55:21] Awesome.  Anything you wanted to share with us?  Any final thoughts?


A:        [55:26] I don't think so.  Just that I appreciate your work and the type of – I think this is all – these are all valid questions and topics.  The planet is changing pretty rapidly, and I do wholeheartedly believe in the importance of farming the sea and supplying food that is as local and sustainable as possible.  I think that we need to have sea farming as a part of our plan for feeding the planet.  It’s not a perfect system.  I hope that through more talking about things and sharing the knowledge that we have, and asking the hard questions, we'll get to the systems that will help us improve on the best ways to produce that food and keep the oceans clean.  


I think that sea farmers are some of the best-poised people to be advocates for water quality and for keeping our planet clean.  I think sometimes there's a misconception that the people who are working the waterfront maybe aren't environmentalists, and it's just such a – that just doesn't make any sense to me because we really are.  We rely so much on it, and we're out there all of the time.  Yeah.  I think just paying attention to that and being able to share dialogs about what's happening and the changes that we're seeing, and to try and collect as much information as possible so that we can continue to thrive and to move and adapt as we're going to have to of things that we can imagine coming down the road and things that we don't know yet.


Q:        [57:07] Awesome.  Thank you so much for your time.


A:        [57:08] Yeah.  Thank you.


END OF FILE"
"13","Q:        [0:00] We’re recording. 


Q:        [0:02] Great.  And we like to start by asking how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:04] I'm Lauren Gray.  I run Cranberry Oysters.  It's a woman-owned woman-run farm, all female staff, five acres in the pool off Great Cranberry Island.  And yeah, it's like a small to medium-sized oyster farm.  


Q:        [0:25] Great.  And what year were you born? 


A:        [0:29] 1984.  


Q:        [0:32] And can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:34] I grew up in Buffalo, New York.  It's a great town, really, really wonderful people.  And I'm actually delivering oysters there.  I made a connection and I ship them out to my hometown, which is a lot of fun.  


Q:        [0:51] That's really cool.  Yeah, I’d love to come back to that, ask some more questions about that.  So you grew up in Buffalo, New York.  How did you end up here? 


A:        [0:58] I went to school at Colby College and I met my husband there.  He grew up on Great Cranberry Island and so we wanted to come back here.  He wanted to run his family boatyard, which he took over with his brother.  And I ended up as the teacher in a two-room schoolhouse, one of two teachers for about five years out here.  And yeah, it was great.  We went from 17 kids to, at one point we had nine.  So different school populations, but it was a great run.  


Q:        [1:37] Wow, in your husband's family, I know there are some families that go back a lot
of generations here.  Is he a multi-generational Great Cranberry family? 


A:        [1:47] Or they are, but not in the sense that – Heather Spurling was working on my farm and she was in eighth generation Islander on Little Cranberry Island, which was amazing.  His family, his parents, summered here and then Ed decided to stay.  So his boatyard is second generation.


Q:        [2:10] And what about your parents?  Where are they from?  What did they do? 


A:        [2:12] They're from Buffalo, New York.  My mom is a teacher and my dad's a plumber.  They're retired and still live there and their parents were also from there.  


Q:        [2:23] Great.  And do you have any siblings? 


A:        [2:26] I have one sister and she is in Salem Mass and she's a teacher.  So yeah, three teachers for a little while there and then one bailed out and went into oyster farming.  


Q:        [2:38] So do you have any history of fishing in your immediate family or extended family?  


A:        [2:44] Not in my immediate or extended family.  Fishing was something I picked up to make extra money in the summer when I was teaching and I really loved sterning.  I was working on Danny Fernald’s, boat, the Wind Song.  I also fished for Rick Alley on the Island Girl and just realized I really wanted to be out on the water and have a life on an offshore island.  And the career opportunities were a few and far between.  So oyster farming looked better and better.  I heard about it from the Island Institute and my friend Joanna at Bar Harbor Oyster was just getting started and I thought I think I can do that.  I think I can get that going, lobster licenses weren't available at the time and it wasn't really a reality.  I think there was a seven year waiting list and I just thought I want to own my own company and run it and so that was the answer for me.  


Q:        [3:45] And then you mentioned that your husband's family ran the boat yard so they have a background.  Not in fishing necessarily but in like water – boats.


A:        [3:53] Yes, yeah, a strong background in water and boats.  And I had that background as well just driving boats as like a young person.  So it felt pretty comfortable.  But yeah, I think in the in the boat business there's a lot of moving boats around so that was accessible and just having waterfront access was huge in the beginning.  


Q:        [4:18] And then this we have covered this to some extent but just to kind of ask the question, to give you a chance if it brings you thing else up for you – so not only do you have any history of fishing in the family but do you have any history in your family or your husband's family of sort of other roles in the fishing sector such as boat keeping, fish processing, marketing, working with bait or gear.  


A:        [4:40] I don't believe so.  Yeah.  


Q:        [4:43] The boat side.


A:        [4:45] Yeah, boat side, definitely but no one in the fishing industry.  My husband's siblings, one of them, his oldest sister works for – I believe the National Science Foundation making trips to Antarctica.  And so she's a really badass lady doing really cool things with like massive boats on research missions.  But that wasn't something that experienced firsthand.  I would just hear about her amazing journeys.  


Q:        [5:20] And then you mentioned Colby, going to Colby could you describe a little like your educational background?


A:        [5:26] Yeah, I was an anthropology and writing major and really didn't know what to do with myself and was taking an end of your quiz on what would be like a good job match, and apple farming was my number one match and I just thought, oh my goodness, I just paid so much money to go to this school.  And now my number one match is an apple farmer like how am I going to make this work? 


And just sort of dismissed it.  And I just look back on that and I think it's so funny because oyster farming, I think, is pretty similar to apple farming.  There's just the element of the water and the ocean.  So it's a lot of paying attention, a lot of – yeah, tending to various things and a lot of tedious and physical labor.


Q:        [6:21] That’s hilarious that apple farming was an option.  


A:        [6:24] I know it just seemed so random that that's what the test selected.  


Q:        [6:29] Well suited to your role, and so you mentioned  – we have a question are you married?  You’ve mentioned I think that you are? 


A:        [6:37] Yes, yeah, I met my husband in college and we ended up coming back here to his
his like family island and kind of trying to make it work.  Kind of working here summers and working on the mainland and then we finally really committed to moving out to Little Cranberry Island when I got the teaching job.  


Q:        [6:59] And what year was that, the teaching job? 


A:        [7:03] Oh, that's a great question.  It must have been 2013, I want to say perhaps 2012, 2013.  My friend – I was doing some subbing and my friend who was teaching at the time went out on maternity leave to have her baby and I jumped in and then she didn't return the next year and I got the job.  


Q:        [7:31] And do you have any children? 


A:        [7:33] I don't.  Just dogs, rescue dogs.


Q:        [7:38] OK, so I'm going to shift a little more to stuff you started to talk but to dive into more like your role in the sector of the farm.  So how would you describe your role in the fishing or aquaculture industry in Maine? 


A:        [7:50] I started my farm as pretty much a single owner operator.  My husband was helping me just sort of get squared away and make some connections and like basically use his resources to get my farm off the ground.  And I ran it that way just kind of finding friends to help for a while.  And now we're about a medium size farm.  We put 350,000 oyster seeds in the water every year and I have five employees part-time, all women and yeah, we distribute pretty much on Mount Desert Island and then just made some new connections where we distribute to Boston and then they go out from there.  


Q:        [8:44] So you also mentioned Buffalo, right? 


A:        [8:47] Buffalo, yeah, so that's how I made my Buffalo connection.  I've been distributing through Wulfs in Boston and a childhood friend really wanted to get my oysters to Buffalo for an event he was having and so Wulf’s was able to make that connection and get them there.  Now they're one of my biggest buyers which is really neat and it's just it's just very cool to see that full circle connection because I never thought how am I going to get oysters to Buffalo.  It just sort of found me and happened and Buffalo has a huge – they import a lot of seafood so it's very popular there so.    


Q:        [9:28] That's really cool.  


A:        [9:29] Yeah.


Q:        [9:30] To your hometown? 


A:        [9:31] Yeah.  


A:        [9:32] And so you've kind of already covered this rest but maybe if you can just – if it brings anything else up or you want to recap, how did you get into your work with a aquaculture and not have the family background but (multiple conversations; inaudible) –  


Q:        [9:44] Yeah, so I was teaching and with the island school, it's a two-room schoolhouse and kids go there from K thru 8.  That was how it was at the time that I was teaching.  Now they go off island for seventh and eighth grade.  But I knew I couldn't stay as the teacher forever  – the kids that I started with they'd had me for five years as their teacher and it was all going well.  I loved the job but I didn't think that I could stay in that position for 20-25 years so I was fishing summers.  I knew I wanted to start my own business and I just had learned about different forms of aquaculture.  


I think the Island Institute had some sort of advisory group so I jumped in and took a few classes with them and just started researching.  Joanna was getting her farm off the ground and I went over and started working for her a bit just learning how they were putting gear in the water, helping her out.  And yeah, then I just decided to try it here and it was different – it's a different environment, we're three miles offshore.  Each farm is so unique so you just have to figure out your challenges and there's not a lot of people telling you how it's done.  It's not like jumping in a lobster boat and having all these people in your community kind of helping you out and showing you the ropes.  There wasn't anybody doing it out here so the two lobster men that I'd worked with were incredibly helpful in just coming up with ideas and good locations for me.  So I went and applied for limited purpose aquaculture site just to get started.  And yeah, that's how I got off the ground.


Q:        [11:43] What year did you get your LPA? 


A:        [11:47] 2016.


Q:        [11:49] And then from there you're a permanent leaser – what year would that have been? A year or two later?


A:        [11:53] The standard lease, I didn't get that until it was probably about 2020 – 2019, 2020. It's a long process but I felt really happy because I had 100% support from my community from the people who showed up at my hearing.  And I met all 10 of the
lease criteria so it just felt like a huge win that I had all that community support and people really wanted to see something happen here.  I think the Cranberry Isles were unique in that respect, that they want to see industry and people working here year-round and they realized that's really important for the vitality of the island.  


Q:        [12:37] So were you the first aquaculture sea farmer out here on the Cranberries? 


A:        [12:41] That it's I think we were about tied.  Janice Murch, a summer resident – she had started a farm with a lobsterman, Scott Bracy, kind of managing her farm and they
still exist.  They’re doing more bottom culture and I think they have an LPA that's in the pool.  So she was here and she also has some other interesting projects.  She's got like an apple orchard and she runs a general store or owns a general store.  Hollie Stanley runs it so.  


Q:        [13:17] Often I know the leasing or the review process for leases there can be a lot of contestation around, but it sounds like you're saying it was really embraced here on the islands.  Like you granting your lease and starting even though there hadn’t been a lot of aquaculture here before.   


A:        [13:31] Yeah, people definitely had a lot of questions.  The hearing went on for a long time but they were supportive.  I think the funniest one was just that they thought that oyster farms caused red tide so just like clearing up a lot of misunderstandings.  And I think it helped that I had been lobstering and had gotten a lot of advice from lobstermen on like a location that wouldn't be interfering with lobster.  


Q:        [14:04] And so you have a standard lease do you own any other or do you hold any other commercial fishing licenses.  


A:        [14:10] I have a five trap license for lobster that I just used.  I also ran the Little Cranberry Yacht Club Community Sailing And Education Foundation for a few years and that was really fun because I got to get kids out on the water and one part of it was sailing but the majority of things that we did while I was there was just to explore the ocean.  So we got to fish for lobster check out the oyster farm and just do all kinds of fun projects to see what was growing in the in the ocean around them.  


Q:        [14:44] That’s great.  And do you have any experience in the industry beyond direct harvesting, for example bookkeeping, bait and gear preparation, theservice processing, marketing, or trade?


A:        [14:56] It's a do-it-all kind of thing so yeah I definitely keep the books.  This is the first year that I have hired someone to help me with that.  With marketing, there’s  oysters – (inaudible) really importation and farmer that's all contributing to such a unique product.  So just trying to make your product stand out as something really incredible to get the recognition it should.


All that’s through Instagram and social media.  I think  – yeah bookkeeping and then all the different hats you wear like building gear, boat maintenance, you kind of have to just jump in and do it all I think when you're getting started.  And then as you get rolling kind of like divvy up different tasks for people that you bring on.  


Q:        [15:52] Definitely and do you have any experience in advocacy or community based organizations related to fisheries or aquaculture? 


A:        [15:59] Well I just joined this DMR Aquaculture Advisory Group, which I'm excited about just because of these new regulation changes and how they affect different people.  I'm excited to represent a small to medium size farm on an offshore island.  I think that's a pretty rare thing but we're here there's more than one so.  


Q:        [16:21] Really quickly, I'm going change the batteries in these.  (multiple conversations; inaudible)  And then this hasn't come up but if in case it brings anything up for you in terms of other roles in the fishing and aquaculture, do you have any background in research and development or working the hatchery side? 


A:        [16:40] Yes, so I taught science when I was the teacher at the schoolhouse for K-thru-8
and I love research and just asking questions and running experiments.  So
I pursued a couple of grants just to focus on that and so I have a SARE grant this year, Northeastern SARE and I'm experimenting with growing urchins and oysters side by side as companion species.


Q:        [17:14] (inaudible) really cool and what a SARE stand for? 


A:        [17:19] Yeah, I'm sure.  So Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education I'm guessing but that's a guess.  


Q:        [17:28] So how is that going?  Where are you at in the process of experimenting with that? 


A:        [17:32] It's been really difficult.  I was very excited about the grant and had done some  previous research just sort of on my own just asking questions because the big  –one of the biggest things that you have to contend with in farming is biofouling and that's what a large amount of our time goes into.  Pressure washing, trying to keep things clean so the oysters are still growing and it was neat to look at some options for companion species.  And I started talking to Luz Kogson and she's at the Center for Aquaculture Research and she thought it was really unique that I'd been seeing urchins on my farm. 


I'm in a cold water site because we're offshore so she was like that's really neat you should you should just scoop them up and just see if you could put them in some cages see what happens just unofficially.  So that's how it began and then this year we have a whole scientific procedure.  The amount of time that we're dedicating to that experiment is huge.  I think it's how I want to be spending my time so I love that but I really appreciate that they have these grants to make that happen while you're still trying to run a business because then I can put some of them on the  measuring and weekly check-ins.  And that's it's just been fun to like watch it unfold.


And the urchins are living, they're still alive they're  – and so are the oysters that was one of the concerns was how small can the oysters be before the urchins are able to actually damage them or eat them.  So we got through stage one and I think the urchins are kind of focused on the biofouling .


Q:        [19:26] That’s (inaudible) interesting do you think  – do you have any predictions yet as to whether that's something you'll sustain in the future like whether it'll have been worth it?


A:        [19:36] Yeah. I think one thing that's troubling is that the type of farm I have is a flip farm and we have to just to bake the biofouling off.  We flip that oyster cage and the oyster survive they can be out of water for 24 hours no problem, the urchins cannot. So it's neat like the experiment that I have going on right now just has the cages submerged in the water to make it work.  To make it work in the future I was kind of secretly hoping that the urchins would be farmable and that I could also just grow them and have this additional product to have some diversity on my farm.  And I'm hoping that that's still a possibility.  I'm not sure what kind of problems I would run into with just farming urchins alone, but yeah I think that so far it's been working and we'll just see at the end of the growing season if they were able to enhance the growth on the oysters.  If that's the case then I can see a lot of people
really wanting to have urchins on their farm.


Q:        [20:46] It's really interesting.  Do you have any – in terms of experience in the sector too, have any experience with like food service food preparation or kind of customer interface with seafood which could imclude shucking events?


A:        [20:58] Yes, (inaudible) Maine and initial phases and the advice from my mentor was do not try to you know get into all the things.  Well now that I'm down the road and oyster margins are low just farming and producing a lot of oysters is pretty difficult and so you can see why farmers diversify and have tours and shucking events.  So we jumped in and we have one biweekly shucking event this year at The Salt Market, but really so much of my focus has just been on dialing in the farming. And I do appreciate that advice I think that was really golden when you're getting started in the beginning you just want to have a hand in everything.  It was great to hear don't do that just focus and do one thing well.


Q:        [21:52] Is it something you imagine you might do more of in the future.


A:        [21:56] Yes, I think it's fun – someone that's out there growing this product that I really believe in.  It's fun to watch people enjoy it and engage and taste oysters for the first time or say like wow, I really had these other ones and they tasted completely different and be able to explain to them why that's happening.  And I think that's a part that I enjoy as a farmer, so it is exceptionally difficult being offshore on an island but we've made it in.  I think like the women that I'm farming with enjoy that customer interface as well.


Q:        [22:37] Great.  And this will probably be hard question for a small business owner but if you could describe what an average day of work looks like for you and you can pick sort of different seasons too if you wanted to give us like a contrast of how that might look different throughout the year.


A:        [22:51] Absolutely.  So the beginning of the day is like just getting to my farm is a challenge.  It’s very tidal and I have women that work on or live on Islesford and women that live on Great Cranberry and when the tide is out I can't pick everybody up.  So I have to have different activities going, some shore some on water and we have to know the time when the tide is going to fill to roughly 3.5 to 4 feet and that's when we can actually get in and get everybody together.  


So it's a lot of logistical – like usually the night before I'm thinking out who's going to be where and doing what. When we get into the pool we go to our float which is on our standard lease and it's a three-sided shed and we usually start one of many processes like tumbling oysters to chip off that outer edge of the shell or sort them by size.  We do hand sorting for market size oysters.  We usually have somebody get no wetsuit and start swim flipping all the cages.  We started doing that just because it's not as hard on your body.  And then we have people building gear or pressure washing in shore just to keep things clean, keep all that algae and sea lettuce and all different kinds of kelp from overtaking the whole farm. 


Yeah, and then we're also bagging ice now and getting all that ready so that's like a typical day.  And then as we get toward the end of the week we start running oysters for different pickups for market, so we have to get them to the mainland and that's a big process because we have to be able to get to the oysters.  So if the tide is out we've got to have everything pre-planned in coolers, ice and coolers the night before ready to go.  We have to do a slurry now which is you mix sea water
with the ice to cool down the oysters really quickly and that's all of the new Vibrio regulations.  And once we have that all done then we head for the mainland and meet our vendors and yeah, just send them off to different restaurants.


Q:        [25:23] You also do – do you a little direct consumer pickup.  I mean I saw there's a cooler app just before this, is that sort of just on a case by case basis or do you do that as part of the business model?


A:        [25:34] I am stuck a little bit because I don't have the seafood sorting facility which is necessary for you to basically sell direct to consumer.  So that's been really challenging.  I don't have an ability like if someone comes and asks me for oysters, my neighbor I can't sell them to them.  And you can't sell out of your home during the Vibrio months, July and August. And so, yeah, I have to be able to sell to an enhanced retail establishment and so I'm able to sell to the Islesford Dock restaurant and the Cranberry Co-op.  Both of those are on Little Cranberry Island so it's been really challenging – people know about my farm from both islands and I can't really sell on Great Cranberry right now and it's been frustrating just to have people that have supported me from the beginning not be able to buy my oysters, but that's where we're at just for the season.  And I'm hoping the DMR has some things in the works to open that up so that we're able to sell again to neighbors and friends.


Q:        [26:47] Because Great Cranberry doesn’t even have a facility that would meet that standard?


A:        [26:52] They had the general store the Cranberry General Store.  It burned down, tragically, and then they rebuilt it within the year but it's just been getting going so it's a hope for the future that I can start selling there again, but right now it's not happening.


Q:        [27:14] So shifting a little bit how do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing and aquaculture industry including how others perceive or treat you?


A:        [27:25] My background and identity can you repeat that question?


Q:        [27:28] Yeah, so it could be if you want to speak to your identity as a woman or other   aspects of your identity or your background as somebody from away.  Or, yeah, any of those things that come to mind for you, the answer (inaudible) that you don't feel like it does but just anything that brings up for you in terms of (music) – sorry – 


A:        [27:47] – oops sorry yeah – so I think kind of going back to what I was talking about before with having the support for my community I think a lot of that just had to do with putting some time in and being a part of this community for a little bit.  I was the teacher here and also just wore various hats and was lobster fishing so I think my idea for having an oyster farm was well received.  It would maybe be a little bit more alarming with someone that hadn't been here for very long but I think people often comment about being a woman in the aquaculture industry and I have had so much support.  I think there's an incredible group of fishermen on the Cranberry Isles that are part of the Cranberry Co-op and they have daughters and wives and mothers and we're just so excited to see me become a part of the fishing industry and so curious.  They’re environmentalists and they love just learning about business and what could grow in the water and I think sea farming was really intriguing and new for a lot of those guys.  So a ton of support and I think it was really an advantage to be female and starting a business on the water on the Cranberry Isles.  I don't think that's the case everywhere but I think that I had an advantage in that way.


Q:        [29:45] Great, and how does your role in the fishing or aquaculture sector work with any family or caregiving responsibilities you may have? 


A:        [29:54] I think when I was starting my farm I didn't have a mission to have all women working for me but I do think that it sort of ended up that way in the early years
because women on the island were wearing all these different hats and had to be 
piecing different jobs together to make their lives work.  And so when I was looking for part-time labor people were really ready to sign up and happy to go work on the water and wanted that experience boating.  And those people were women so it worked out well and we just started having fun with that and I think it helped distinguish the brand too just to know that it was a really supportive and
inclusive environment.  So I think kind of referencing that that caregiving is 
with female caregivers just having to have more flexible schedules and be able to inshore quickly for signing up to go offshore and fish and not have any flexibility in their day.  Oyster farming just lended itself well to that just being a little bit closer in.


Q:        [31:21] Great thank you so shifting to questions sort of about environmental changes things you've observed in your time and how those might be affecting you can you describe any changes in the marine environment that you've noticed? 


A:        [31:35] Well I would say the storms I think coming off of this last winter that was something I hadn't seen before and a lot of people commented – fishermen that
have been here for years saying they had never seen southerly storms of that magnitude again and again and again throughout a single season.  So that was pretty scary and kind of a wake-up call to realize climate change is affecting us.  


Q:        [32:08] And can you describe for us so we have it on the recording  – you were telling –showing us some of the damage it did to this building we’re in right now.  Could  you describe how the storm impacted your business? 


A:        [32:17] Yes absolutely, so it was January I think when the first one really hit and the tide –just the surge was so huge so things that I'd had kind of back from the water I had to scramble down here and pull further back, gear, equipment.  I had all my cages on the bottom thankfully but just the swell affecting my float that was grounded out on the high tide and just picking that up and slamming it on the shore.  Bringing all kinds of debris in, whole telephone poles.  Everything was just getting washed up
and I have this waterfront building that I rent and that was just  – the walls were just pummeled and completely the inside flooded and one of the corners was actually picked up and shifted and it's a rickety old building so it's like barely standing as it is.  So just the amount of damage that that single storm caused was just huge and they've had lovely grants and opportunities for people working waterfront to be rebuilt.  Unfortunately we didn't really fall in the category but you know the the building's still standing so I'm thankful for that.


Q:        [33:51] Is there anything you've done to kind of respond to that – those impacts or adapt perhaps to the future of potentially more storms? 


A:        [34:00] Yes, so I think just the way I'm sinking my oysters will change and also the mooring setups that I have were all based for northerly storms and I'm definitely thinking more about that south facing direction and how I can make sure everything's really fastened down.


Q:        [34:22] And do you think those changes you’ve made are helping or is it sort of
too soon to tell? 


A:        [34:31] Too soon to tell, everything's kind of in process.  I just got another huge mooring
rock and some chain and all those things have to be set out on the farm.  I think  just making sure those anchoring systems are really intact and also making sure everything is down on the bottom, because you know that one hit in January but I was still farming through December.  So just knowing that one of those storms could hit and really take out what I have out there.


Q:        [35:02] A big, huge heat risk.  In addition to storms are there any other changes in the marine environment that you've noticed that might be impacting your work?  


A:        [35:10] I haven't noticed any Vibrio bacteria personally that hasn't showed up on my farm but that's statewide and that has definitely impacted our process.  Just the marine regulations, Vibrio's naturally occurring in the ocean environment and
multiplies over 50 degrees Fahrenheit and the ocean temperature is higher than 50 in the summer so when we get the oysters out of the water we have to really cold plunge them to bring that temperature down make sure Vibrio isn't developing within the shell just the ocean water that's in the shell.  


So that means a lot of ice and being a small, medium-sized farm on an offshore island I did not have access to a well, a building that's heated to store all this equipment, this ice making equipment and freezers but I had to just make it work so I've got two different ice machines.  I wasn't able to go to a gas station and buy ice.  There's no gas station here and obviously that would hurt my margins even more to be paying for ice every time I harvest.  So everything's really heavy also.  So I have deliveries with these sort of cold water ice and sea water mixes and
we're trying to lift coolers that are full of water and oysters and ice and that's difficult.  Luckily we have hoists in Northeast Harbor and that's something we're going to be looking at is just having equipment like big insulated coolers that can be lifted with hoists rather than two women wheeling them up the dock.   So just like kind of bracing ourself for heavier work ahead.


Q:        [37:09] And then with Vibrio you mentioned that you all haven't actually experienced any  challenges with it but the new regulations – do you feel like those are linked to climate change or environmental change?


A:        [37:21] Absolutely, yeah we were not a Vibrio control zone but with the warming water there was an increasing concern for that and I think they had found Vibrio in Maine last year and that's what prompted the DMR to really make these changes for consumer safety.  So everything's been going well this summer, all the farms have been posting about doing their cold plunges and ice slurries and so I think you know people are optimistic and that's good.  


Q:        [37:56] Are there any other changes in the marine environment you want to tell us about? 


A:        [38:03] I guess people tell me about seeing different species showing up.  I don't have anything that's particularly present in my mind.  I know this year was a big mussel set year and we've had a lot of problems with barnacles.  I don't know that those
are necessarily new but just kind of part of what's happening and I'm sure enhanced by warming water.  Better growth.  


Q:        [38:35] Just dealing with the biofouling. 


A:        [38:37] Yeah.


Q:        [38:38] So in terms of the things you've tried to kind of respond to these changes and you've described a few things.  What has made it possible for you to kind of make those changes or adaptations to your business?  For example are there resources
you're drawing on – relationships, knowledge training or organizations that have been helpful for you?


A:        [38:58] Yeahm the Island Institute's been really helpful they have a Tom Glenn Impact Fund that is a small grant but it's just if you can apply for that and get $2,500 to support buying a piece of equipment that you otherwise wouldn't be able to purchase that's huge.  So I've been the recipient of that grant multiple times.  And then I'm also looking at using one of their grants for putting solar panels on my farm so that we can run more of these processes like our pressure washing without using a generator which would be a more enjoyable workplace for us and also better for the environment without that engine running all the time.


Q:        [39:45] (inaudible).  And then in terms of kind of the new moorings and that you're trying –did that just mean kind of drawing on the resources of the business or kind of what made that possible?


A:        [39:57] A lot of that is me being very scrappy.  So a friend was selling his sailboat – getting rid of his mooring.  I have some friends that have been very supportive and their mooring inspection business and have like cut pieces of chain for me that I can piece together with shackles.  So a lot of it's really scrappy.  It's not like there's any additional money there it's just it's a new challenge to invent and make something work.


Q:        [40:34] And do you feel that you've been able to make the adaptations and changes that you want to your business to kind of respond to these environmental changes that you're experiencing or are there some kinds of adaptations you wish you could make but haven’t been able to? 


A:        [40:49] Oh yes, everything feels out of reach all the time.  I think with being in the oyster business – it's not really – there's not huge margins, especially with the small farm. So I would love to have a seafood sorting and processing facility and obviously the cost of land and putting up a building and all those things are just so insurmountable so there's always more to do.  And I think kind of just trying to take it a year at a time and hang in there is the philosophy I have at the moment.  I would love to be able to have more options for selling products and yeah, that means having that type of facility and having that permit to be able to sell direct to consumer.


Q:        [41:40] And then I think – so this has come out in how you’ve answered other questions, but I just wonder if there's anything you want to say about how doing this work on an offshore unbridged island – like how those environmental changes make – different for somebody like you then somebody onshore?


A:        [41:56] Yeah, just that I think feeling like a bug on a windshield when you're on an offshore island is like the turbulence of just trying to get to the mainland to drop product off.  And if there's high winds and I'm trying to get oysters to shore it's one thing to have a 19-foot Carolina skiff on your farm, it's another thing to try to try to make that gap, the three mile gap to Northeast Harbor to meet a truck in a small boat in the middle of winter.  So just trying to draw on resources and borrow and use different things that that people are willing to give and provide I think  – yeah I've had to really lean on my husband's business and the resources that he has he and his brother and his family have just been so incredibly supportive in doing that.  I think it just feels like everything has to be bigger and buttoned down and ready to take on like big winds and big seas.  So you wouldn't think that it would feel that way when we're we don't feel that far away from the mainland but it definitely is a journey.  But even just like washing oysters when it's so cold out and just being able to have some protection from the wind and all that kind of stuff.


Q:        [43:28] And what do you feel like is your biggest concern about the marine environment
for the future of Maine’s fisheries and aquaculture industries?


A:        [43:37] I think I'm really worried about being a small farmer and being priced out.  Just the avenues and what I'm able to sell and where.  I have to distinguish my product from somebody that's growing a million or two million oysters a year.  I really want to show that it's hand grown and sorted and it's basically an heirloom product and to be able to do that I have to have a higher price point.  


But I'm kind of being forced into the avenues that all these other bigger growers are using as well, so I can't really with the licensing that I have, go to farmers markets.  I can't do that without a Facility.  I can't sell direct to a lot of restaurants because the hassle of having the enhanced retail license just isn't worth it for them, so losing sort of the local support in restaurants just because the regulations can become kind of difficult for them is tough.  It's not that I don't believe in them I think they're there for a reason and I support being part of the systems that the DMR has in place.  I think I just have to be thinking creatively about how I can still get my product out there with my brand in a way that that makes it special.


Q:        [45:07] And then following up on that if you could tell policymakers in Maine kind of what the biggest priority or priorities should be to kind of help people in the industry kind of adapt some challenges what would you tell them?


A:        [45:19] I think that kind of creating – I know like different farmers use seafood facilities
together and have that sort of partnership and just being able to sort of accommodate the little guy so that there are – you can have farming at different scales.  We don't want to see kind of just all these massive farms that are wonderful but it's like great to celebrate small growers too so I think just making sure that there's some loopholes or windows that they can kind of create a small
scale system and still follow all the rules.


Q:        [46:05] Great thank you.  And have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation trainings or programs for fishing or aquaculture industry.


A:        [46:16] I haven't, no – yeah that would be lovely, I would love to participate in something like that.


Q:        [46:23] What strategies do you think would be effective in building resilience against climate related impacts in fisheries or aquaculture?


A:        [46:30] I guess, yeah, just it would be great to see  – to hear more about like what predictions and changes are ahead and I think just hearing – like obviously our water temperature up here is much colder than it is in southern Maine and so
you can be looking at just going a few hours south like what are people seeing there.  Sharing information, sharing strategies and I think this is a great industry and people are really supportive of each other and willing to do that.


Q:        [47:04] Now we've asked questions about kind of specific environmental changes but are there just other types of changes we didn’t talk about in marine environments specifically that are impacting your work that you want to tell us about?


A:        [47:16] Oh other types of changes that are impacting my work.  Nothing – I guess like nothing that's on the horizon immediately but I do worry about just changing geography and what my farm is even going look like in a few years because I have this really special tidal inlet that has kind of these barriers that create warm water, the pool fills, and it warms and I think it's a great location for growing oysters.  I definitely saw those seawalls being knocked down and the high tides coming like right a foot up to the height of what was remaining and just thinking like this is really – this could look like a different body water.  And something that would be less advantageous for me.  I would not have the protection from the offshore water coming in that I have now.  So yeah, just worried about geography and erosion I think are like the big things that I'm thinking about.  And those things are really beyond my control.  So – yeah.  


Q:        [48:41] So kind of an infrastructure being able to kind of like be sustained with those changes and keep your site – and like a ideal site.


A:        [48:52] Yeah, I think like if I lose even a few degrees in temperature which I gain from just having a protected tidal inlet – the growth of my oysters would change radically so they would really slow down and it would be a longer growing season.  And
the longer your oysters stay on your farm the more costly it is.  It's not necessarily bad for your product.  Cold water oysters tastes delicious but it would be tough to have a longer growing season for sure.


Q:        [49:29] And about how long does it take you to grow an oyster a market (inaudible)?


A:        [49:34] It already takes me four years so I already have a really cold water growing site and I think people recognize that and love it and definitely now remark on the flavor.  But if oysters are hanging around for longer it just means more equipment more labor – yeah just more care and handling.  So that's intimidating.


Q:        [50:00] (inaudible).  Can you describe any opportunities or positive changes you might have experienced in the industry during your time?  Kind of any positive changes?


A:        [50:09] I think there is a more  attention toward aquaculture – or just in the beginning from when I started in 2016 until now.  There's just more awareness about the fact that people are growing different species and the popularity of different species is growing,  and the products that are available especially with kelp and that's really neat.  I think that all helps to think about consumers making choices about sustainable proteins or sustainable products and keeping clean oceans.  It's great to see people understanding more about the different flavors that they experience with oysters and indulging in oysters because they know that oysters filter water and are great for the environment.  And you can eat oysters and feel good about it.  


Q:        [51:07] Great have you noticed any changes in kind of women's participation or roles in the sector in your time? 


A:        [51:13] Yes, I think there are so many women-owned farms and I think that's wonderful especially small scale farms and people getting started.  I think the barriers to participation are not as high as with lobstering because you can start with a really
small boat and you can stay pretty close to shore as you gain experience.  And I just think that's wonderful to see and I think woman-owned farms create great products.  So – 


Q:        [51:43] Thank you. What would you describe as your hopeful vision for the future of Maine’s coastal fisheries and aquaculture? 


A:        [51:51] My hopeful vision?  I guess better distribution.  I think that's been such a challenge about keeping products in Maine and especially up by us.  I think they've got
great things going on in southern Maine and distribution to local restaurants.  And I think Joanna's got that going for Mount Desert Island but we don't really have much of a connection to Portland even.  It feels worlds away so just looking at strengthening that Maine brand by creating better distribution and keeping product in state and creating different price points for different farms.  I think that is a hope of mine.  I love when people recognize my product as being something really special and are willing to pay for that that helps me as a farmer hire people and have the support I need to keep the farm going.  


Q:        [52:55] Great, thank you.  Is there anything else you want to share with us? 


A:        [53:02] I can't think of anything – yeah I guess that's probably it.  I just think it's a great industry and it's really supportive and it's wonderful to see people farming
on the ocean.  I think it's a win for everybody.  


Q:        [53:25] Is there anything you wanted to ask or (inaudible)? 


A:        [58:28] No.


Q:        [53:29] Wonderful, I’ll go ahead and end the recording then.  


A:        [53:31] Thank you.

"14","Q:        [0:00] All right.  We’re here with Addie.  Addie, how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:08] My name's Addie Huckins.  I've been fishing out of Northeast Harbor for the last three-ish, four-ish years now.  I’m graduate of the college.  I'm just figuring it out. (laughter)


Q:        [0:28] What year were you born?


A:        [0:30] ’99.


Q:        [0:31] ’99.  When did you start fishing?  What year would that have been?


A:        [0:37] 2021.


Q:        [0:41] Can you tell me where you grew up?


A:        [0:43] I grew up in northern Michigan, in the Keweenaw Peninsula, two hours north of Marquette.


Q:        [0:51] Where are your parents from, and what did they do?  


A:        [0:54] My dad's from Montana.  He's a fisheries biologist.  He does stream ecology and trout monitoring in a bunch of endemic coastal brook trout populations that are threatened by mining activity.  So, he's a fisheries guy.  My mom's from Michigan, and she's a botanist that works with local land trust organizations to help people put their property into a trust, and then she does native plant work.  If you go to her and you're like, “Oh, I want my property to be more ecologically sustainable native plant gardens,” she'll do that.  


Q:        [1:47] Wow, that's awesome.  Do you feel like having that background really influenced –?


A:        [1:52] Oh, absolutely.  I had a very clear idea of my path.  I didn't know what each step was going to be specifically, but I was like, “OK, I'm going to go to college and do the thing and do the thing and be like them.”  They're incredibly supportive.  I'm very lucky because I was getting experience in the field doing working with grad students on their projects when I was a kid. (telephone rings) Sorry.  Charlie.  So, when I was a high schooler and a middle schooler, I was with my dad and his grad students working on their projects out in the field, going with my mom to native plant symposiums.  So, coming into COA, I had a really good foundation to work with for what I wanted to do with research and an understanding of academia in a way.


Q:        [2:59] Wow, that's awesome.  That's really unique.  Do you have any siblings?


A:        [3:03] I have one little brother, just turned 21, and he's about to go out west to Oregon for an internship with – I don't think it's Fish and Wildlife.  It's one of the Fed departments.  He's a cool guy. (laughter)


Q:        [3:22] You kind of touched on this, but do you have any history of fishing in your family?  This can include parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins, or relatives?


A:        [3:31] Not in a commercial way.  I definitely come from a family of outdoorsmen, I would say.  The men in my family love fishing, but it's way more River Runs Through It, and way less – they're not commercial fishermen.


Q:        [4:02] Do you have any history of family working in other roles in the fishing industry, such as bookkeeping, fish processing, marketing, bait, or gear work?


A:        [4:10] The closest that would come was my dad working as a guide out of Glacier National Park that I'm sure was fly fishing related, but still, a very well – that would be way more on the ecotourism sector, I would say, than the fisheries sector.  There might be a tiny bit of overlap.


Q:        [4:38] Cool.  Did your dad teach you how to fish?  


A:        [4:40] Yes.  My dad and my grandpa. (laughter) Yeah.


Q:        [4:44] Was your mom into it at all?  


A:        [4:46] Yeah, yeah.  She was definitely into it.  It was a whole family affair, yeah.


Q:        [4:53] Cool.  Are you married?  


A:        [4:56] No.


Q:        [4:57] Do you have any children?  


A:        [4:58] No, thank God.


Q:        [5:02] Can you describe your educational background?


A:        [5:05] I went to a classic standard Midwest public high school in Houghton, Michigan, and then I came to College of the Atlantic and graduated after five years. (laughter)


Q:        [5:24] I’m going to shift into your role in the sector.  How would you describe your role in the fishing or aquaculture industry in Maine? 


A:        [5:32] I work as a sternman or a deckhand, so I have stayed on the same boat for the last three years, but my position has shifted as new people have come on and the crews changed.  Yeah, basically, I work the square end.  Square end is my business, and he can deal with the pointy end.


Q:        [6:05] How long have you been doing that?


A:        [6:08] I think I started in ’21.  2021.  Maybe 2020.  But definitely, I was fishing in the summer of ’21.


Q:        [6:16] Is it just in the summers, or do you do it year-round?


A:        [6:20] Year-round.  This is the first winter that I haven't fished since ’21.  I said, “I'm out when my hands get cold.” (laughter)


Q:        [6:31] How did you get into that work?


A:        [6:34] One of my friends was going to be living with a lobsterman who was looking for a sternman, and I was also looking for housing.  He was like, “Oh, I've got a friend who works on boats.  Maybe she could be her sternman.  She also is looking for housing, so maybe she can move into the house.”  We talked, and it all worked out.  I ended up moving in with them and then working for that fisherman, and that's how I got into it.  


Q:        [7:09] Do you remember what you felt like before starting the job?  


A:        [7:13] I was definitely anxious.  I knew I had a good starting – I wasn't coming in completely green.  I worked as a work-study on the school's research vessel, on the Osprey.  Even though I had no commercial fishing experience, I was like, “I can tie up a boat, I can drive a boat, I can fuel up” – all of those basic boat things.  It's like, “You don't have to teach me those things.  You just have to teach me the fishing things.”  I was anxious about it, but I knew that I at least had a good foot to start off on.  But I was scared.  Those first few months, I was scared all the time.


Q:        [8:03] What kinds of things were scary?


A:        [8:06] It's very open and vulnerable, especially in Northeast, which is a very busy harbor.  So, new things where there's a lot of commotion right by.  Everyone's watching you.  You're trying to back up the trap trailer on the dock, and there's like 50 men watching you, and they do it every day, and they can do it without thinking, and running the like hydraulics and crane and everything.  It was a lot, and it was very overwhelming at first, especially because you're moving such heavy things.  There's a lot – when you're not used to it and it's new, it feels really dangerous and scary, like loading traps from the pier onto the boat and loading bait from the pier onto the boat.  You've got 1000-pound barrels of fish swinging around, and you’ve never done that before.  


The first captain I worked for also definitely was like, “How you perform reflects on me.  So if you fuck up, that's on me also.”  So, I was very scared.  He basically was like, “People are going to be looking at you extra because you're a girl, and I don't want that to reflect poorly on me.  So, keep it tight.”  I was very nervous.  I didn't want to mess up.  It’s easy to mess up.  There's a lot going on.


Q:        [9:50] Amidst all the scary stuff, what hooked you to keep doing the work?


A:        [9:55] I think part of it was the scary stuff.  I liked that aspect.  I love being out on the water.  I love going to bed tired.  You put in a lot of like work, and that felt like – I don’t know.  It felt very primal, like I am doing work that feels like there's a product at the end, especially after coming out of school where I’d been spending so much time on my laptop, writing papers for hours and hours, versus being like, “OK, I am outside, moving my body, getting shit done.”  It felt very rewarding in a physical way, and I was like, “I can do it” – that I could do it, and it made me want to keep doing it.  It’s classic man quits job, goes fishing in Alaska vibe.  I was like, “OK, I want to keep doing this.”  Yeah, it got me.


Q:        [11:16] Did you feel when you were in the learning stages that you had some level of support in the community or with the people you were working alongside?


A:        [11:27] I felt very much an outsider of the community at first, especially, it was like, “Oh, you’re the girl from up at the COA.”  And I was like, “Yeah, I am.”  I was young.  People, if they knew me, there were whispers.  It’s like, “Oh, there’s that girl who’s from COA.  She's one of the tree-hugger hippie people.  So, I felt, yeah, very unsupported at first, but not in a necessarily bad way.  I was just like, “OK, I am doing this, and I'm going to figure it out.”  My first captain was not super warm and supportive about that journey, but would – “Yeah, you did good.”  I’d be like, “OK, I did good.”  Especially because we lived together, so, there was weird dynamics with – “OK, we're going to go to work together, and we're going to work and then drive home together and then eat dinner across the table from each other.  I think, at first, he was also trying to not – he was trying to keep friendship at home and how he was on the boat very separate.  So, I think you might have been a little more cold, too, with the “Great job,” pat-pat kind of stuff.


Q:        [13:12] Yeah, that's interesting.  Most of the time, you don't go home with your boss.


A:        [13:15] I wouldn't recommend it. (laughter) I would say don't do that, actually.


Q:        [13:21] I'm curious.  How do you feel your education – maybe a similar topic – how did that relate to the work you were doing, if at all?  


A:        [13:34] Absolutely.  I had a nice continuity because most of my time at COA, I would say, was focused out on the research islands.  I spent three summers on Great Duck and would hop around to the Rock.  I was working on Osprey.  I went from boat stuff, island stuff, and would interact with the lobstermen out there around the islands, not always in the best way.  But listening to the conversations on the radio.  I was very used to it in a good way.  Coming off, I had all the boat experience from working on Osprey and from landing on the islands.  It just transferred really nicely.  I was like, “OK, I’ve been spending all this time on the water on boats.”  I’m just going to keep doing that in a different light, but it felt like I couldn’t – I don’t know.  It would have been a lot harder for me to start fishing had I not been doing that throughout all my time at COA.  


Q:        [14:55] Do you hold any commercial fishing licenses?


A:        [14:58] I do not.  


Q:        [15:02] Do you lobster inshore or offshore?


A:        [15:04] Inshore?


Q:        [15:06] Do you own your own boat?  


A:        [15:07] No.  


Q:        [15:08] Do you have any experience in the industry beyond directly fishing or harvesting itself, for example, in bookkeeping, bait or gear preparation, in post-harvest, processing, marketing, trade, in advocacy, or community-based organizations related to fisheries?


A:        [15:24] Yeah, I would say in the post-fishing preparation.  There’s a lot of times where I’ll make sales with people on the island.  I also work for my captain’s wife in her restaurant.  That’s a nice full day when we go out, we get her basket of lobster and crabs or whatever she wants, go back, pick them out for her, bring them to the restaurant.  Some days, there’s a nice 48-hour loop where I get to go fishing, do all of that, and then I work in the restaurant the next day and get to sell the lobster rolls from the lobster that we caught yesterday, which is the most satisfying thing ever.  So, there’s that aspect of it.  I definitely help with bait, planning, and preparation.  We crunch the numbers of how to do our bait recipes, what makes most sense, and some of that behind-the-scenes stuff.


Q:        [16:42] Can you tell me more about the – not your secret bait recipe.  Can you tell me a little more about that?


A:        [16:47] Are we going to do herring and redheads and skate this week?  Are we going to do alewives and pogie and black cod head?  All of the different options you have for bait.  Frozen, fresh – are you going to get it boxed frozen in the little boxes?  Big box frozen in the big boxes?  Are you going to go to the bait yard and get whatever they have?  Then, figuring out – it’s like, OK, however much it costs, we know we don’t want to spend more than however much on bait this week.  But bait might be staying really well in the water.  So, you can leave it a long time, and that might change how we do the break-up – more hard bait instead of more soft bait.  Or maybe it’s summertime, the sea fleas are out, and the bait’s really going quickly.  So, it’s all of those factors and variables of cost, how long it’s going to last in the water, how soon we’re planning on getting back out to that gear and then coming up with a bait plan for the next week or next two weeks, or whatever.  It’s like, OK, are we going to buy 30 barrels of pogie?  Now, that will take us however long out to the month.  That whole number-crunching game plan, bait game plan. (laughter) Yeah.


Q:        [18:37] What does an average day of work look like for you?


A:        [18:41] I get to my captain's house at 5:15 in the morning.  We load whatever we need to load at the house – if it’s buoys, trap trailer, whatever – head to the harbor, or if there's someone else we meet (inaudible) there usually is.  Meet the other crew in the harbor.  Head out to the boat.  Get that bait preparation done if we need to get bait from the float onto the boat or if we need to unbox frozen bait from the truck or whatever ponds (sp?) need to be moved for that day.  Get all that done.  Aim to be out of the harbor – we usually leave about 6:30, heading out after all of our boat loading.  Then, we haul steady until 2:00, 3:00, or 4:00, depending on the day.  Head back in.  Scrub down on the way in.  Figure out if it makes sense to do bait prep then or the next morning.  Go up to the restaurant for an emotional support snack and process.  We have a little decompression session in the truck of whatever happened during the day.  Then, head home. (laughter)


Q:        [20:22] I know it's work, but do you have a favorite part of your day?


A:        [20:27] Heading out and heading back in are really pretty good feeling.  OK.  Well, the skiff ride out in the morning, and the skiff ride back in – that’s got to be probably my favorite part.  Getting back in on the skiff, leaving the float, and going back in towards the shore.  That’s prime feeling. (laughter)


Q:        [20:51] Good sunrises and –


A:        [20:53] Good sunrises.  Yeah.  It’s warm.  You can think about what you’re going to eat for dinner. (laughter) And you don’t have to do anything else. (laughter)


Q:        [21:03] Yeah, morning, you're ready to go.  


A:        [21:05] Yeah.


Q:        [21:06] Evening, you're ready to go as well. (laughter)


A:        [21:07] Go.  Yeah. (laughter) 


Q:        [21:11] I'm curious, do you guys source your bait from the same dealer every time, or is it different?


A:        [21:17] It changes a lot.  Bait is getting crazy and expensive, so I would say last summer was probably the most consistent, where we were buying from the bait yard.  Well, yeah, it still goes all over.  There’s almost never super extreme consistency with where we’re getting bait.  Prices change all the time.  Might get a bad barrel from one dock.  So, it’s like, “OK, well, we’re not going to go there this week.”  Also, this dock has whatever – they fill their barrels up to the top, or they’ve got it salted.  So, there’s no – we hop all around all the time.  I feel like more recently, more individuals have started working to go – people are driving down to Boston now, loading up trailers with bait there because it’s cheaper, and then driving it back up here and then selling it, which is new because you have to go further to get cheaper bait.  


Some guys are starting to go in on little partnerships with that or they buy in bulk.  If someone has a good yard for it, then they, as individuals, will sell to other individuals.  So, if you’re “in the know” about how so-and-so is going to get fifty barrels of herring, he’s going to drive down with his trailer to Portland, get a bunch of bait there, and drive back.  That, I feel like, is becoming increasingly more common than just the one bait dock where everyone is going to go for their bait.  More scheming of how we’re going to get it.  Yeah.


Q:        [23:28] That's a lot.  Is that something that's being navigated on a daily basis or weekly?


A:        [23:34] It's nice when it's weekly.  It's hopefully more weekly or monthly.  We usually get enough bait so that we don’t have to get it again until the next week, ideally.  So, yeah, a week, week and a half, sometimes two weeks, is usually the turnover time for planning.  


Q:        [24:07] Got you.  Remind me again where you fish out of?


A:        [24:10] Northeast Harbor.


Q:        [24:11] Northeast Harbor.  For selling, do you guys sell –?  What's that look like for you guys?


A:        [24:17] We've also moved around a lot recently, but this past year, we started selling to Ronnie Musetti, who owns The Nor'easter, because he started buying lobster.  Let’s see.  Last year, we were selling to Trenton, the Trenton Bridge Lobster, but also sometimes to the guys in Southwest.  It’s also the numbers game of who has the best price versus your loyalty to someone you’ve been selling to for a long time is also becoming a weird thing.  We might show up to Southwest one day and be like, “Hey, I heard so-and-so’s buying for this price today.  Are you going to match it?”  And they’re like, “No.”  And you’re like, “OK, maybe we should stop selling to Southwest.”  


I would say there’s also more increasing infidelity with you you’re going to sell to.  We’ve changed it up probably four or five times, at least, in the last few years.  Even a few times within a summer.  People were selling to multiple different places at a time.  Ronnie will get the nicer lobsters that we know will get a better price, and then Southwest can have the standard crates or whatever happens that time.  It’s crazy.


Q:        [26:21] That influences the day.  


A:        [26:22] Yeah.  


Q:        [26:23] (inaudible) workday for sure.


A:        [26:24] It's like, “OK, are we going to steam all the way over to Southwest?  Are we just going to home?  Well, then we have to crate up on the dock.”  And then it's like, “Ugh.”  Yeah.


Q:        [26:31] How do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing sector, including how others perceive or treat you?


A:        [26:39] I feel like I have – OK.  I definitely had cosplayed in the beginning when I first started fishing.  I played up the more rural side of my upbringing.  I was like, “I’m going to hide the COA parts and just appear more rural,” I would say.  Then, as we got more comfortable and got to know each other, I started speaking more freely about what I was thinking.  It’s fun because I love it when people ask me questions about what we’re seeing, like, “What’s that bird?” or “What’s that fish?”  I think that’s a cool dynamic that I get to have with people that I work with, is that people will ask me about the things that we’re seeing and why it’s happening because of my research background.  Sometimes, we’ll stop the boat and be like, “What’s that bird?” or “What’s that fish?”  That’s cool because I feel like it didn’t happen in the beginning when I wasn’t being as honest about myself.  


Also, there’s a lot of screaming and fights that we have sometimes.  I don’t know.  It’s weird because it affects all of our interactions all the time every day.  I’ve, over the years, been more upfront about how I actually am feeling or thinking about something.  There’s a lot there.  Yeah. (laughter) There’s a lot there.  I definitely am not fully 100% myself when I’m at work, though.  I think I can have more productive work and conversations that way.  


Q:        [29:31] That makes sense.  How does your role in the fishing sector work with your family or caregiving responsibilities, including future plans, if relevant?


A:        [29:44] I hope it doesn't. (laughter) I’m not quite sure.  My version of my nuclear family is going to my housemates at home, and they’re like, “Oh, long day.  Addie’s not home yet.”  I’m like, “Well, maybe I’ll bring you a treat and bring home …”.  I do have fun being provider – bring home crabs for dinner sometimes.  Yeah, I don’t think – I haven’t thought about it. 


Q:        [30:29] That’s OK.


M1:        [30:31] I’m wondering, to the point of question about background and identity – I’m wondering if you feel like your gender has any role in that.


A:        [30:37] Yes.


M1:        [30:39] Can you talk more about that (inaudible)?


A:        [30:40] Yeah.  So, I feel like I have multiple layers that I had to work through in the beginning to just get my footing and my bearings and have people be like, “OK, yeah, she deserves to be here.”  The first one was, yeah, you’re a young woman.  People are going to scrutinize you more to start with.  Then, it was like, OK, so it’s like, young woman, comes out of COA.  Suspicious.  Looks like one of them tree hippies.  Suspicious.  Worked out on the research islands, so liberal.  Suspicious.  So, I was working through these layers of identity that I knew were going to make it harder for me to make connections with people.  So, I would morph.  Yeah, I’m just a hard-working horse girl from the Midwest – was how I would choose to, in the beginning, be female because that was a more acceptable entrance point.  


I feel like if you’re not familial – it’s standard and common for sisters or daughters or wives to go out with their male family counterparts.  It’s like, OK, yeah, that’s cool and cute and good and normal.  It’s like, “Oh, she’s going with her brother.  That’s so nice.”  But if you’re not in that bubble of girl working on boat, I feel like the other bubble that you immediately get put into is very sexist, weird, misogynistic, gross – “Oh, this is obviously not women’s work, so there has to be something really wrong with you for you to be doing it.”  Either you’re strung out, and you really need the money for drugs, feels like a common – “Oh, well, what’s wrong with you for you to be here?  You must have some dirty, weird issues with you.”  


It’s hard because it’s like, OK, I’m not in that bubble, and I really don’t want to be in that bubble.  I swear there’s nothing wrong with me.  But it does feel like there’s a weird assumption because, increasingly, there’s more and more women on boats.  I feel like there are – especially in the Bar Harbor fishing community, maybe.  There’s some guys that pretty much only have female sternman, but it’s maybe because they’re more like pervy old dudes who want to look at their female sternman all day.  Obviously, they must be kind of easy if they’re going on this boat.  So, there’s all these weird – I don’t know if they’re stereotypes or assumptions about why you would be on a boat as a woman.  Because obviously it couldn’t just be because you like the work.  Does that answer your –?  I went off on a huge, little tangent there.  Yeah. (laughter)


Q:        [35:06] That was really interesting.  With all that, do you feel like there's room to grow on the boat, change your role, and how do you feel about that?


A:        [35:18] Yeah.  I mean, my role definitely has changed.  I went from being very quiet, kept my head on, I’m going to get the job done and not draw any unnecessary attention to myself.  I don’t want to make it obvious that I’m young and a girl and new to this, so I’m just going to shut up and do it.  My role in the beginning was way more timid, obedient.  I was just going to get it and not cause a scene.  As more time has passed, I’m comfortable on the boat.  I spend most of my time on it.  I spend most of my waking hours with my captain.  We’re comfortable.  The more comfortable that we got, then the more I would be like, “Hey, actually, what if we did it this way?  Maybe that doesn’t work.  Maybe we should try something else,” or just be more vocal and willing to share thoughts, I guess, in terms of both boat planning and conversation that was happening on the boat.  


Now, I love my captain.  The family is like family to me.  I know that they’re – if I stop fishing, I’m not going to leave – they’re not going to leave my life.  We talk on the phone. (laughter) He jokes that I can’t leave because not only – I’m stern-girl, therapist, bookkeeper, secretary, dog sitter, house watcher, which is such a huge change from how my relationship was both to him and the boat in the beginning.  Now, it does feel more like adoptive family, which is really nice.


Q:        [38:00] I’m glad it got to that point.  


A:        [38:02] Me too. (laughter)


Q:        [38:04] I'm going to switch into questions that deal with environmental change.  Can you describe any changes in the marine environment that you've noticed?


A:        [38:15] Water is getting warm.  I would say there are more crabs than ever – green crabs, rock crabs, small little crabs inshore.  Surface water temperatures are warm.  There's so much like biofouling on gear.  I would say from my first year to now, even in that very short time frame, I’ve noticed that I’ve seen less kelp, more tunicates, more crabs, more sea fleas, more jellyfish.  Fewer schools of baitfish like herring and pogie.  More shrimp, which is cool.  The shrimp are coming back.  


There’s a whole lot of change happening.  It’s all related, but changes with fisheries  here affect our bait choice.  If you could use nothing but herring every day and not spend all of your money on it, that would be ideal.  But there just aren’t that many herring left, and there aren’t that many pogie left.  So, you keep jumping from the next best option to the next best option.  It’s like, OK, well, now that option’s gone, and now that option’s gone.  


It’s something that we saw on Great Duck with our gull colonies out there because if we haul up a trap and there’s old bait from last week, 20 years ago, you’re going to dump that pocket overboard and put fresh bait in.  But that’s not a financially viable choice anymore.  So, you’re going to bait on top of it.  But if the herring fishery is taking a huge source of wild food for herring gulls, let’s say, then the new option would be old bait that’s dumped overboard.  It’s like, OK, now that is the standard food that we’re seeing gulls bringing back to their chicks.  It’s like, OK, you can tell that’s old bait.  It doesn’t have scales.  It’s kind of mushy.  We know that the gulls are eating old lobster bait.  Then, fishermen stop dumping their bait overboard.  Now that option is gone.  So, gulls start bringing back weird jellyfish.  Never should a gull be choosing to forage and bring back jellyfish, which has nothing to it, for their chicks.  Which, just to me, was a very visual – it’s there.  You can see it.  That was a change that has been happening.  


You hear people talk about – I remember two summers ago the scallop boats were having a really hard time.  I just remember hearing someone say on the radio, “Shells like fucking pie plates, and they’re all dead.”  They bringing up – it’s been harder and harder for people to find scallops or find live scallops.  I just think about that a lot.  They were finding huge, dead scallops in places that are good dredging waters.  


Lobster are moving.  It’s getting harder and harder to fish inshore.  Traplines that we had in spots a few years ago that were just ass-deep in lobster aren’t – it’s just too warm.  It’s too warm for them.  Our better gear is our offshore gear along the three-mile line most of the time.  But what should have been the standard predictability of it’s early spring, we’re going to get a big rush of lobster moving in, and then it’s early summer, and we’re going to get a big rush of lobster moving out.  All of these patterns that people have been generally depending on for years aren’t happening anymore, which makes it really hard to plan where you’re going to set your traps and how you’re going to invest in bait because normally, you can have a sense of, OK, it’s August, water temperature’s however high.  If we set our strings of traps in this channel, we should get lobster as they’re moving in or offshore, or however that seasonal pattern that you should expect to be there happens.  


But it’s just been jumbled chaos of, “When’s it going to happen?  When it’s going to happen?”  They haven’t hit yet.  When are they going to hit?  Then people are like, “Well, maybe they’re never going to hit?”  People are like, “No, they have to.  They have to be somewhere, but they’re not where we expect them to be and not where they’ve been for the last 30 years.”  Then the joke is like, “Well, how’d you do for crabs?”  It’s like, “Oh, we got shit-ton of crabs.”  Everybody’s doing great for crabs.  The bottom ecology is definitely changing.  


Last summer, Diver Ed was in – where was he?  He was looking for – he was hired to dive to find some lost traps up in the sound and said that the bottom of the sound was just covered in dead pogie.  Around that time, we were seeing a lot of dead pogie floating on the water or in traps.  It’s not uncommon to occasionally have a pogie swim into your trap, but there were dead pogie all over.  Then, Eddie said the bottom of the sound was just covered in dead pogie.  It’s weird.  That’s an anomaly.  Weird things like that have seemed to be happening more and more.  


Q:        [46:26] Thank you.  How do those changes impact your work in the fishing sector?


A:        [46:32] They make it harder.  It feels more like flying by the seat of your pants instead of being able to generally have a plan for what you’re going to do with your gear and your bait.  Bait is always cost.  Regardless of what you catch, you’re going to spend the same on bait.  If you’re not making that money back because what you have known to be true for the last 30 years isn’t happening anymore, and your bait and fuel and crew are still steady, consistent costs in your day-to-day, it’s hard to stay afloat.  You don’t have the – I feel like almost everyone has, for the long time, had the security of being like, OK, even if it’s not a good year, I’m still going to make it by.  I’m not going to go backward financially.  That isn’t necessarily a given anymore.  


If there’s no herring or very limited amounts of herring, and herring costs $600 a barrel, and you’ve had a bad few weeks and you really need to catch some lobster, and you think that – well, lobster love herring.  Maybe this is how I get my money back, and you’re going to buy this expensive herring, put it where you have known lobsters to be for 20 years, and they’re not there, and you just spent $1200 on nothing.  That’s becoming more of a reality.  


Then, it’s like, OK, well, now, what else can I use for bait?  Maybe alewives.  It’s like, why are we using alewives for bait?  Ecologically, that’s a nightmare, but the bait fish that you should be able to depend on and rely on, the herring fishery shut down early, and the pogie fishery shut down early.  It’s like, OK, well, I guess we’ll use alewives, which aren’t as good of a bait.  The ecological impacts of that are horrendous.  Who knows?  It’s like, OK, what else will we use?  Maybe we’ll use frozen rockfish from the Pacific, the West Coast.  It’s like, OK, wait, so we’re using bottom – we’re fishing for groundfish in the Northern Pacific, freezing them, shipping them to Northern Maine to use as bait here because we can’t find our bait fish anymore.  


We used frozen red racks (sp?) that were shipped from Germany three years ago.  There was a day where I was using bait from Washington, bait from Germany, bait from Florida, and bait from Maine and New Jersey.  Like, what?  Ecologically, that’s a nightmare.  It’s sad to think about.  I have to turn off my brain most of the time when I go into work because I can’t think about it because it’s just so depressing.


Q:        [50:45] Yeah.  You’re filling the bait bags and trying not to think about it.


A:        [50:47] I’m not thinking about them.  I’m just like, yeah.


Q:        [50:51] In addition to the bait, is there anything you've tried in response to cope with or adapt to the different changes?  This can be where you fish or what you fish for, when you fish, the gear you use, or pursuing other livelihood opportunities.


A:        [51:12] I have the nice freedom to be able to do that.  The fishing strategy has changed.  We’ve gotten more used to shifting gear around midseason and not being too tied to any one region.  We shifted gear all the time last summer.  If the string wasn’t doing well, we’re going to pick it up, move it somewhere else, and hope that maybe it will do better there.  We aren’t using the primo bait options, but to find a good midpoint of cost and effectiveness, it might not fish the best, but it might last a bit longer.  So, we’ll use that combo of bait.  Yeah.  Just finding ways to cut costs and just be more willing to not have to stick with the plan if the plan isn’t working.  


For the most part, people are freaking out.  If all of your assets and livelihood are tied into your business, which for most fishermen they are, and then your business isn’t running how you need it to run, I think it’s pushed a lot of people for an early retirement or an early game change.  But for a lot of people, that’s all they know how to do.  I’m worried that a lot of fishermen are just going to – it’s like running into a brick wall where it’s not working, but you need it to work because you don’t know what else to do.  Change is scary.  Even with however much adaptability and flexibility with what you’re doing, it’s still not enough.  Then you hit a point where you almost have to keep going because it’s not like you can just stop.  


Q:        [53:46] What has made it possible to make those adaptations?  For example, are there any resources, relationships, knowledge, training, organizations that help you guys navigate those adaptations?  


A:        [54:04] Everyone loves Maine Lobstermen’s Association.  MLA is a pretty good supporter.  But in terms of what help people that I know have received, it’s almost nothing.  We know that the MLA is fighting for the cause of lobstermen, but in terms of individual support, there’s been next to nothing.  People talk about – Janet Mills was going to give you a $5,000 check if you went through this whole application for financial hardship.  What’s $5,000?  So, most people didn’t even do it.  Yeah, it’s something, but it’s nothing.  It’s nothing for the operating costs of a boat.  Yeah.  I can’t really think of anything.  There’s a pretty strong anti-handout feeling that I think might keep people from looking for those sorts of programs.  God forbid you’re like the Canadians and get paid to not fish.  That’s crazy.  I can’t think of anyone that I’ve known that’s gotten help like that.


Q:        [56:04] Are there kinds of adaptations you wish you could make but haven't been able to?


A:        [56:09] I have been trying to get my captain to think about diversifying.  I forget what the name of it is.  There was a group that I reached out to where their work helps lobstermen diversify their income by getting into aquaculture, I think based out of Portland or Biddeford or somewhere.  It’s a really cool group.  For years, I was like, “Hey, we should start some kelp lines.”  He’d be like, “There’s no money in that.”  I’m like, “But there is.”  I finally got to the point where he was finally considering it, but then I was like, “I don’t know.”  Then I reached out to this group, and they were like, “We need more information.”  That would be the strongest thing that I’ve tried to implement is trying to get him to at least have some winter macro algae support.  


I wish I could remember the name.  They’re a group that would subsidize fishermen trying to expand into aquaculture so that you know you have a buyer for your harvest, which is probably one of the hardest things about aquaculture, especially kelp and seaweed farms.  If you don’t know who your buyer is, then you waste a whole season of growth because the harvest is two days.  Then you’ve got all this seaweed and nowhere to sell it.  This organization takes that risk away because you know who your buyer is.  I think they subsidize some beginning costs for gear.  But if you’re a lobsterman, you already pretty much have all the gear, knowledge, and skills that you need to start doing aquaculture.  


I think the Nordic fish farm has put a sour taste in people’s mouths when they hear aquaculture – they think of salmon pens – as an opposition.  You hear aquaculture, and you think it’s easier salmon pens or good fishing ground and that there’s no ability to coexist or work together or have that be an integrated, economically viable way to make a living.


Q:        [59:01] That’s really cool.  How did you come across that organization?


A:        [59:05] Instagram. (laughter)


Q:        [59:09] What's your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future of Maine coastal fisheries and aquaculture industries?  


A:        [59:24] I would say warming waters and fishery collapse.  There’s so much bait that people use all down the coast.  It’s so many fish.  We’re rerouting the flow of – the fishing industry reroutes trophic flow of nutrients on a massive scale.  If climate change is your starting foundation for how – that’s hardship enough for these marine communities.  Then, if, on top of that, you have massive amounts of bait fish being taken out of the most vital trophic level and being shot down to the bottom as bait food, that’s not helpful.


Q:        [1:00:45] If you could tell policy makers in Maine what the biggest priority should be to help people adapt to this, what would you tell them?


A:        [1:01:00] Oh, gosh.  Having people who look familiar because they are also fishermen have – people need resources and help but aren’t going to accept it if it comes from some high up fed.  Don’t trust those guys.  They’re not looking out for me, obviously.  But if someone who I work alongside and fish alongside is working with those policymakers to be like, “OK, guys, this is how we should implement these changes” – there’s just so many oppositional factors against the fishing industry right now that it’s hard to think about how effective help and change – what that would even look like because it just feels like there’s so much to overcome.  It feels like there's so much to overcome that I don’t even know what the help would look like.  It’s a big problem.  I don't know.  It's hard.  I think ground level – having help and support come from ground level or what appears to be community is, I think, far more effective than a top-down, trickle-down approach because there’s just so much distrust and frustration there that it’s hard to think of how that could actually be productive.  I hope not, but I don’t know.


Q:        [1:03:35] I think having the conversation is helping build the bridge.  So, good on you. (laughter) I’m going to shift into climate resilience strategy questions.  Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training or programs for the fishing industry?


A:        [1:03:54] A little bit.  Mostly in my social media, aquaculture networking way, but no, I haven’t seen what a workshop for fishermen would look like.


Q:        [1:04:18] Do you have something in mind that would be helpful to you?


A:        [1:04:24] I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.


Q:        [1:04:31] What strategies do you think would be effective in building resilience against climate-related impacts for fisheries?


A:        [1:04:41] Not describing them as climate-related impacts.  It’s hard because fishermen are aware that their ocean is changing.  They know it better than anybody else, and that’s a point of defensiveness, where it’s like, “Well, I spend my time out there.  Who are you to tell me that it’s changing?  I know it’s changing.”  But then, you reach a standstill where it’s like, “OK, and then what?”  They’re like, “Well, then, nothing.”  When I’m having conversations like this, I word things very – I beat around the bush.  We’re not going to talk about climate change.  We’re going to talk about what is palpable and avoid these scary buzzwords where you’re immediately going to get a defense up against it.  


So, language is incredibly important, I think, and probably, in my opinion, one of the most misused and mismanaged ways that the fishing community and NOAA, the DMR, and these regulatory agencies are not connecting – ineffective use of language.  So, how conversations are worded, I think, is the first step to even gain ground on how to help.  Could you repeat the question?


Q:        [1:06:47] I think it was here.  What strategies do you think would be effective in building resilience against climate-related impacts for fisheries?  


A:        [1:07:05] I wish there was – in a way, not that I wish anything was subsidized because I don’t think that would actually really help, but fishing is one of the only industries where you never know what your product is worth.  A maker should be able to set their price for their good, and fishing doesn’t work like that.  I don’t know how that change even would or could be implemented.  During COVID years, you would buy a lobster roll in Bar Harbor for $45, and we weren’t seeing that money.  It was $3.18 a pound.  Our selling price was $3.18 a pound, but restaurants in Bar Harbor are getting $45 for half an ounce of lobster meat.  That’s ridiculous.  


Fuel costs are rising, and bait costs are rising.  At the end of the day, you still don’t know what your own paycheck is going to look like.  In a way, one of the reasons why the lobster industry has been so successful, I think, is a lack of market regulation in that way.  But I think now it’s also really hurting people because the work is the same, the cost is the same, and increasing.  Each year, we’re making less and less money for the same and more amount of work.  But someone is making a lot of money for almost no work.  I don’t know what or how that would look because, again, overhead and regulation is scary, but that’s just a – yeah, I don’t know.  That’s huge.  


Q:        [1:09:44] Are there other changes, not only environmental, that are impacting your work that you want to tell us about?


A:        [1:09:55] There’s a whole lot of change happening.  I think environmental change is definitely causing the most distress to the industry, and we haven't even started talking about whales yet. (laughter) Probably like on that note, political change –lobster, and especially Maine lobster, has become a really polarizing topic.  People are always going to buy lobster, but just the fear and divisiveness that is coming out of this whole entanglement conflict is making positive change almost impossible because there's so much polarization.  When you've got organizations red listing Maine lobster, it becomes this whole thing.  It's a whole thing now.  


So, political change.  We used to get a lot more money to ship more lobsters overseas to China, but because of some trade tariffs and some presidential stuff, that doesn’t happen anymore.  That’s a huge change in the flow of money and who is buying Maine lobster and why they are or are not buying Maine lobster is huge.  Canada stopped buying last summer for a period of time.  There were lobster floating in crates dying because most of our lobster at this point gets shipped to Canada to be picked and processed and sold as meat, not as whole lobsters but as meat.  But if political change is happening and stuff with Canadian fisheries is changing and all of a sudden, Canada’s like, “OK, we’re not buying any Maine lobster for the next few weeks” – it had nowhere to go.  In a way, it’s like the market is both flooded but extremely confined with buying options.  We need a rebrand. (laughter)


Q:        [1:13:08] You mentioned whales.  Did you want to say anything more on that?  


A:        [1:13:12] I could say a lot on that.  It's, I think probably the most perfect example of a human ecological crisis that I can think of.  I started at COA.  I worked with Allied Whale.  I was on those boats doing whale research.  I came out of whale research world.  I’m still in whale research world.  Then, I went to the commercial fishing world.  I think, in a way, I’m really lucky because I have a very fluent idea of the issue on both sides and how, again, miscommunication and improper use of language is snowballing a problem into something way harder to work with.  


Also, how people communicate in small, isolated rural communities and access to information and how greatly that varies.  I can sit here in my little ivory tower and walk over to Lexus Nexus and have whatever information I want at my hands because I know how to fact-check, and I have been taught how to research and find information for myself.  I have internet and wi-fi and someone to go to give me more information about something that they’re an expert in.  Versus if I lived in Bernard and didn’t have wi-fi and most of my communication is with people that I fish around or when I walk to the public library to sit on the Facebook for a few hours and look at my little fishing Facebook groups.  


The point being that the game of telephone for how information spreads in the fishing community is – I see a paper or something – I see something on Facebook or the news or something.  We’re all tied up in the harbor later that afternoon.  I’m like, “Hey, did you hear about that thing that I saw?”  Everyone’s like, “What?”  They, in turn, go, “Hey, did you hear about that thing that so-and-so saw?”  The language changes a little bit.  It snowballs a little bit.  Someone jumps on Facebook again and is like, “Oh my god.  I can’t believe this thing that I heard.”  Then, over time, that becomes truth.  I feel like truth – this is al also very “woo.”  Truth in this instance of whales is also very relative.  I can have a truth, and you can have a truth that are both true to us but not congruent.  


If I’ve grown up knowing – knowing because everybody in my life has ever told me that no whale has ever been killed in Maine waters in the last 22 years.  It doesn’t happen.  I know because everybody around me knows so.  That’s what they’ve told me forever.  That is truth to me in that moment.  Sorry, I’m going all over the place here.  This is so hard.  


Say I know that no whale has ever been entangled or killed in Maine waters in the last 22 years.  And then, all of a sudden, there’s these pictures of whales with rope hanging off them from agencies that I know are trying to steal my livelihood because it must be political and for money and so-and-so.  They must be lying.  Everybody thinks that everybody has to be lying and the communication is so poor or nonexistent or worsens the issue.  Then, GMR and NOAA implement these gear regulations.  It’s like, “Well, I already spent a shit-ton of money last year on gear regulations.  Why do I have to do it again?”  Well, it’s like, “OK, well, those ones didn’t work.”  It’s like, “What do you mean they didn’t work?  I don’t see any dead whales.”  Then NOAA, on the other hand, is like, “Well, just because you didn’t see them doesn’t mean they didn’t happen.”  Which, to me, if I don’t understand statistics or models or graphs, sounds like you’re just making stuff up.  


I sat in on a scoping session, a NOAA scoping session, for how do you guys, as fishermen, think that we should make gear modifications because we have to because of this federal ruling.  This is something that we have to do because of a federal court decision, and we’re asking you guys for how you think that would be effective.  It was a shit show.  The graphs and models that NOAA was using to predict estimated whale deaths because of entanglement, if you don’t understand graphs and models, it really just seems like you’re making up numbers to fit – there’s this idea, it’s like scientists must create problems because if they didn’t have something to fix, they wouldn’t have a job.  


If information you’re receiving from regulatory agencies is in this very formal, high-level, academic phrasing, which it’s like, I don’t speak that.  That’s foreign to me.  I’m not going to understand that.  But my friend Joe, who I grew up next to, posts something on Facebook in my language that we know.  OK, that’s accessible to me.  The NOAA articles and why we have to make gear modifications is not accessible.  I’ve looped off on so many paths.  If there’s something that you want me to circle back to –


Q:        [1:20:46] No, (inaudible) awesome.  We got to find Joe.  


A:        [1:20:49] We got to find Joe.  Yeah.


Q:        [1:20:50] (laughter) Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes you've experienced in the industry during your time?  


A:        [1:21:01] Not on a larger scale, but in my own – just for myself, a positive change that I have gotten in the community of Northeast, where I am now, feels like a huge social step of progression, at least for me.  I know all these fishermen, and they know me.  We’ll reach out to each other.  I have this network of community where I’m not a stranger there anymore.  For myself, the fact that I was able to do that, feels really huge, especially because I’ve never been super – I’m never super, super open about how liberal or queer I am.  I keep it pretty latched down when I’m fishing.  They know I’m weird.  Everybody knows I’m weird.  But even as a weird hippie, it feels good that at least as a weird hippie, I’ve gotten to that point.  Maybe someone else then can be the next step of weird, and then the next step of weird because I feel like I got to where I am now maybe in part because I kept it a little more latched down.  So, the conversations that I would have with my captain about why we don’t use that word or whatever, I feel like I could have those conversations more in part because I was trying to come off as someone who would identify more closely to something that he would listen to. 


Q:        [1:23:42] Off of that, have you noticed changes in women's presence, participation, or status in the fishery?


A:        [1:23:48] I feel like every year I see more girls on boats, and I love that.  Last summer, we were selling and getting fuel and bait in Southwest.  This girl, who's probably four – dad picked her up and set her on the dock, and she had glittery pink little rainboots and she marched up to the shed where you get your check.  She put out her hand, and they put the check in her hand.  She marched back.  And I was like, “This is it.”  I started crying.  I’m going to start crying.  It was so cute.  She got her check.  She got her money.  She fished with her dad all day.  That was awesome.  It was just awesome.  I do see more.  I feel like I do see more girls on boats every year and younger, too, which is really cool.  It’s not a weird – it’s not normal as in it’s an oddity, but it’s not unfathomable.  It’s probably a few steps in from unfathomable, which is really cool.  Yeah, bit by bit.  


Q:        [1:25:18] Once you're in it, I’m sure the sense of pride is just –


A:        [1:25:24] It’s hard.  Yeah.  It’s hard to leave.  


Q:        [1:25:30] What is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's coastal fisheries?


A:        [1:25:36] I hope for sustainable, resilient fisheries.  I think there's so much cool work happening.  I truly believe in the power of sustainable bivalve protein.  I think aquaculture is going to carry us, but I don't know what – I just don't know what it will look like, but I'm hopeful and excited for it.  I think with more moderation in fishing – it's hard.  Yeah, it's hard because I think – I would love to see a comeback of a lot of our groundfish and our bait fish and the cod fishery.  It’s not unthinkable.  There just is a lot of change that needs to happen to get to that point.  A lot of that is at odds with how, at least at the moment, lobstering works and functions.  


So, how those meet, I’m not sure.  I think it probably goes back to language and communication.  It is, I think, an unfortunate truth that, at some point, if we want sustainable, resilient fisheries, that does mean that big changes have to be made in how fishing works.  Are we talking about sustainability and resiliency in culture and community and the working waterfront?  Is that environmental, ecological resiliency and sustainability?  And how those can shift to meet each other because it often feels like they’re at odds.  Either we protect the working waterfront and the cultural history of these coastal communities, or we protect and stop fishing for – yeah.  I don’t think they have to be at odds.  We’ll be uncomfortable.  


Q:        [1:28:50] Is there anything else you wanted to share with us?


A:        [1:28:54] Probably. (laughter) I don’t know.  I don’t think so.  Maybe I’ll think in writing or something – I’m sure there’s gaps that I’m going to go home and be like, “Shit, I should have thought about that.”


Q:        [1:29:18] Door is open.


A:        [1:29:20] (laughter) Yeah, I’m not going anywhere.


Q:        [1:29:23] Great.  Camden, did you have any questions?  All right.  Well, thank you, Addie.  


A:        [1:29:27] Thank you.


Q:        [1:29:28] Awesome.


END OF FILE"
"15","Q:        [0:00] So, how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:04] Well, I usually introduce myself – full name – Katherine Lipp, but everybody calls me Kat, and it's fun to introduce myself here in Maine now because I moved recently, and I have a lot of family on my dad's side, so when I say my last name now, people are always like, “Oh, are you related to blah, blah, blah?”  The state is so small, so it's been quite – I don't know.  It's been a fun move and being able to drop my last name over here. (laughter)


Q:        [0:30] Nice.  And what year were you born?  


A:        [0:32] 1992.


Q:        [0:34] And can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?  


A:        [0:37] Yes.  I grew up outside of Cleveland, Ohio, in a small town.  It's called Chagrin Falls.  It's very quaint, very just Americana.  It was a great childhood.  I have my two parents and my older sister.  Then, my whole dad's side of the family is from Maine, so we came up here a lot as a kid.  Since I was six months old, we've been spending the summers up here.  I went to camp at Wavus camps and Kieve camps up in Damariscotta.  Then, I went away to school, to university in Florida, traveled to Alaska for about eight years in the fisheries industry, and then now I'm here in Maine.  


Q:        [1:22] Great.  I'm going to return to a few parts of that later.  


A:        [1:23] Perfect.


Q:        [1:24] But can you tell me a little bit more about your parents, what they did, what brought you up to Maine?


A:        [1:29] Yeah.  My parents – my mom's name is Julia.  She was an attorney growing up, and then that took all of her time.  She didn't like how she wasn't spending time with my sister and I, so she stopped when I was about six or seven or stopped practicing.  And then my dad, he's a salesman, so he was able to come up here in the summers and then travel.  He was traveling anyway, so he would travel in and out of Maine.  My dad's side of the family is from the Boston area and then moved to Maine in the early ’80s, Whitefield/Alna area, closer to Damariscotta, and that was my paternal grandparents, and then everybody else sort of started trickling up here, including myself.  My parents still live in my hometown.  My sister lives in North Carolina.  She works for the National Park Service and Forestry Service and wildfires.  We spent a lot of time outside.  My mom always says she should have kept us in ballet a lot longer than she did because Kelsey and I are both just outdoors women.  We just are always outside doing something, her on land more, and me on the water more, but same-same.


Q:        [2:43] Great.  Do you have any history of fishing in your family at all?  


A:        [2:47] No, none at all.  I studied marine science in school, so that was my first formal introduction to fisheries.  We've been really big oyster fans in our family for generations.  My grandpa was the biggest oyster fan, and he would always tell us stories – how he would dry dulse out on the clotheslines in Gloucester when he was growing up.  So, I have sort of a tie to this, more of just it feels very nostalgic hearing about it.  But nobody in my family has ever fished.  My dad was a merchant mariner for a year, maybe.  But I'm the first one diving into the fishing industry.  


Q:        [3:30] That's great.  To the merchant mariner point, did they do anything else in the water when you came to Maine?  Were you on the water?  


A:        [3:35] Yeah.  I guess we were always on the water.  I have two older half-brothers, too.  They were really into sailing.  They did a bunch of J/22 sailing when they were younger, and my nephews are into that as well.  So, just boating experience in general, but nothing involved harvesting or an income from the water.  Just a little bit of merchant mariner when he – I think he was in college, and he was just trying to figure out what he was doing, and that was in the Great Lakes, too.  That wasn't on the ocean.  That was throughout the Great Lakes.  But yeah, I'm kind of the first one, which is very fun.


Q:        [4:14] Great.  Can you describe your educational background a little for us?


A:        [4:18] Yes.  I went to my public high school when I was growing up, and then I studied Marine Science at University of Miami in Florida.  I did that for four years.  I got my undergrad degree from there.  Miami wasn't the greatest fit for me.  I just wanted to go somewhere warm and away from home, mostly.  So, I actually studied abroad my whole junior year just to get a little bit of diversity and different experience.  So, I studied in University of Wollongong in Australia for a semester.  Honestly, not much studying happened.  It was very fun, though.  


Then, my second semester was with Sea Education Association out of Woods Hole in Falmouth, Massachusetts.  That was heavy on the studying.  We also sailed a 170-foot-tall ship from St Croix to Bermuda, New York City, and then up to Woods Hole.  So, the focus on those projects when we were in that semester were fisheries and conservation-related and marine resource management.  That was really my true first introduction of fisheries besides just lectures and at university.  We got to study the spiny lobster fishery in the Caribbean and Bermuda.  That was what my project was focused on.  Some people were studying the glacial migration through Sargassum Sea, which was fascinating to learn about.  I just love the mystery of it.  It's so cool.  


Then, there was another project studying Sargassum, and it was all about how there was no borders – the Sargassum sea – there's really no true boundaries to that sea.  So, it sort of tied together global ocean policy and then fisheries.  That planted the seed in my head that there's a career.  I also loved working on that boat, so I realized that you can actually make a living working on boats and that lifestyle, which was cool.


Q:        [6:30] Great.  And then just two demographic questions: are you married?


A:        [6:34] No, I'm single.  


Q:        [6:36] Do you have any children?  


A:        [6:37] No, children, except Nori (sp?), my cat. (laughter)


Q:        [6:41] Great.  Sort of transitioning now into your role in the sector, how would you describe what you do in Maine's fisheries and/or aquaculture?


A:        [6:48] I am officially an apprentice, an aquaculture apprentice, through GMRI and MAA’s program.  It's a pilot program.  I was one of six of the first apprentices in the state and maybe perhaps countrywide.  They are really focusing on growing the workforce and seeing what the farms need from their workforce and providing that through program development and training.  I originally moved from Alaska to Maine with hopes of getting into the aquaculture industry.  I didn't know at what scope or what scale, but I just knew I wanted to be closer to the family, and then I was interested in getting more into the aquaculture side of things, as opposed to wild harvest or wild fisheries as well.  


So, I'm an apprentice at Mere Point Oyster Company up in Brunswick.  We're on Maquoit Bay, and that has been a great growing experience.  I've been there for about a year now, and I usually – generally, I'm a farm hand in general, but I also co-manage the nursery.  So when we get seed from the hatchery, we grow it up basically for the summer, for nine months, until we can hand it off to the farm manager, and they can grow it to market.


Q:        [8:13] Can you speak a little to what you were doing in Alaska?


A:        [8:16] Yeah, so in Alaska, I moved there right out of college.  I did a couple of different things up there.  First, I was a fisheries observer on groundfish fishing vessels.  We covered boats anywhere from 37 feet to 120 feet, catcher boats.  I never worked on any catcher processors or large, large draggers, and we focused on black cod, halibut, rockfish, pollock using long line pots or draggers.  I did that for three years.  It was contract work, so it was on and off.  It was a great – it was a great schedule for me out of college, and before my prefrontal cortex was formed.  It was quite the adventure.  Most people only do it for one or two contracts.  I really loved the – I loved the industry.  I loved the communities it supported.  I loved being able to travel on somebody else's dime and make money while doing that.  That was really great experience.  


Ultimately, I was tired of living out of a duffel bag, which is essentially what I did for those three years, and I found a land-based, essentially observing job in Northern California for about nine months.  Although Northern California is gorgeous and I loved it there, I just needed to get back up to Alaska.  Alaska always has that draw.  It gets its hooks in you, and you can't leave it.  I ultimately was looking for a job to get back up there.  I worked for – I got a position with a small company called Salmon Sisters, which is more retail and lifestyle brand, but they are a commercial fishing family, and everything is themed around wild fisheries and commercial fishing, and the Alaskan waters.  They have gear, and then they also sell wild Alaskan salmon that can be directly shipped to your door.  I kind of got to know that side of production and getting product across the country and how that kind of works, as opposed to just wild harvest in my fisheries experience or my observer experience.  


So, that was cool to learn.  I worked for them for four years, and then ultimately when I left working there, I worked as a deckhand/farm hand for a sockeye salmon set net site in the Western Cook Inlet, and I worked for a really lovely family that's been fishing that spot for a couple generations, and they're Alaska Native as well.  It was really cool to just get in that aspect of the industry that's sort of been – I don't know – looked over.  Set netting is really hard.  There's no hydros.  It's all like hand-hauled, hand-picked fish, really high-quality stuff.  It was really nice to be on that, as opposed to the large boats that I was working on prior.  It's much more intimate.  Then, ultimately, after that, you either stay in Alaska for the rest of your life, or you have to get out at some point.  So, I took my chance, drove cross country, and ended up here.


Q:        [11:36] Great.  Can you talk a little bit about becoming a part of this apprenticeship?  


A:        [11:40] Yes.  When I first got here, I was living with family.  They live in Cumberland and own a goat cheese creamery, so that was just a fun little stay away to learn about – but while I was living with them, I was just networking around at that point, trying to figure out what scope I wanted to enter the industry.  I was trying to get into more nonprofit work, but I realized, although wild fisheries – there's a ton of transferable skills into aquaculture, and there's a lot of similarities – I realized that I needed hands-on experience and just be a farmhand for a little bit.  


Actually, I networked with Annie Fagan.  A mutual friend put us in contact with each other, and I met her for coffee up in Bath.  She was the one who initially told me about this apprenticeship and was pretty adamant about me applying, which I’m forever grateful for her because I got that position.  I think they chose those in February or March.  They selected a select few people, placed them to different farms, and then the farms would interview you.  I interviewed with the Mere Point crew, and then they selected me as their apprentice, which is really great.  Yeah.  Does that answer your question?


Q:        [13:11] Yes.  I'm curious, with all of that, from initially going to Alaska to now, so how many years have you been involved in fisheries or aquaculture?


A:        [13:16] Going on ten years now, yeah, which seems like a lot now.  So, essentially, when I graduated college, I've been always involved in some aspects of wild fisheries and now aquaculture.  


Q:        [13:29] Great.


A:        [13:30] A good 10 years now, which is in the double digits.  Feels good.


Q:        [13:31] Yeah, that's awesome.  And then I'm guessing I know the answer to this.  But just for the sake of asking, do you hold any licenses?  


A:        [13:40] No, I don't.  I don't hold any licenses – wild fishing or aquaculture.  When I began this process, I didn't even think about having my own LPAs or anything like that.  But I've recently, in the last month or so, been eyeing maybe just a small little LPA for some oysters or something experimental even – would be interesting.  That's the cool thing about aquaculture, is you can dip your toe in, and it's not too – I don't know.  The investment doesn't have to be too great at the beginning.  So you can sort of explore, which is neat.  It's exciting.  


Q:        [14:20] Yeah.  Can I ask you maybe about your dreams with that?  What would that look like?


A:        [14:23] So, if I had my own – if I had my own farm, that would be great.  It would probably be like an inner tidal that's really easy, hands-off oyster.  And then also, I think I would just tie it really closely to my family.  My family – we have a bunch of small businesses throughout, and again, my grandpa was a big fan.  So, I’d probably just – it would probably all just be an homage to my family, to be honest with you.  Growing good food in a sustainable way is important to me, so it'd feel good doing that.  That is probably a five or 10-year plan right there.


Q:        [15:04] Yeah, great.  I’m going to ask you a few questions about your experience.  You may have touched on some of the things I'm going to ask you about.  Feel free to repeat that.  Or, if you don't want to repeat it, talk about something else or whatever feels right.  


A:        [15:15] Cool. 


Q:        [15:16] Do you have any experience in bookkeeping, bait, or gear preparation?


A:        [15:22] No bookkeeping.  Well, I mean, I'm familiar with regulations and logbooks.  That was something that I would have to check with captains when I was working as a fisheries observer.  I'm familiar with regulations and things like that that are required.  And then bait – yeah, I've baited a few hooks for long lines.  Sometimes, if it's a hand-baiting boat, that takes hours and hours, and sometimes, I had nothing to do, so I might as well help the crew when I was observing.  I hate dealing with lobster bait.  We didn't use pogies up in Alaska. (laughter) I think lobster bait is so gross.  I don't think I could be a lobster.  I don't know if I could be a sternman, but yeah, power to it. (laughter)


Q:        [16:09] Great.  And what about any experience in hatcheries or research and development related to fisheries or aquaculture?  


A:        [16:15] Cool.  No.  I’ve only studied it from my own personal regard, and I got to visit the Downeast Institute for my apprenticeship.  So, in the apprenticeship program, there's 2000 hours of on-the-job training and then 144 academic hours.  So, those academic hours, I've gotten to learn a lot about the hatchery business.  I think it's fascinating.  Maine is pretty unique as well in that, at least in the oyster and seaweed production, you have to get product from within Maine, whereas other states like Massachusetts, that's not necessarily the case.  So I think Maine is really unique, and I think it's a good call.  But also, that being said, there's only three hatcheries that you can choose from, or four, perhaps, in the state, so it's limiting also, and it's only what the hatchery can make available.  But I think the hatchery side of things is pretty interesting.  It's much more scientific, which might pair well with my background.  I've thought about just dipping a toe and helping out at a hatchery sometime just to get the experience.  But no direct experience myself.


F:        [17:26] We say hatchery, but you talked about – 


A:        [17:31] Oh, nursery, yeah. 


F:        [17:32] I’m just thinking of the grow-out pre the oyster getting put in the cage on the farm. You do have –?  Would you speak a little (inaudible) – 


A:        [17:38] Well, I’m not – yeah.


F:        [17:40] – should expand on wording on that one because your experience, I think, is what we meant by that.


A:        [17:46] Yeah, great.  So, hatchery – yeah.  We received the seed from the hatcheries.  Since we're a large farm in the state, and we don't have our own hatchery, we're usually first on the list.  We've already gotten two batches of seed from Muscongus this year at 1.2 millimeters, I want to say – 1.2 to 1.5 – which is pretty small.  Then, on our side of things in the nursery, which is at Mere Point, we essentially – nursery is a bit of a loose term, but we refer to it from the point of getting seed to maybe up to an inch and a half, inch-75, and then we hand that over to the market, the guys who are keeping track of the market oysters.  


We don’t use FLUPSYs, though, so I don't actually have experience with a floating upweller, but we use green seed bags, and we care for them every single day.  There's husbandry every single day with those, which is like washing making sure that we hose them off with – it’s a high-volume, low-pressure hose.  We just wake the shit out of it with a boat, which is really easy, but it's quite fun.  Then, we've been doing a bit more aggressive flipping schedule to keep them clean and shaping well.  They've already grown.  We got those two weeks ago this year, and they've grown.  I mean, they've at least doubled in size already, which is really crazy.  They're growing really fast this year.  It's hard to keep up.


F:        [19:28] Those guys are out in the marine environment? 


A:        [19:31] Yeah.


F:        [19:32] It’s in its own site, or (inaudible) site?


A:        [19:35] Our whole farm – we have a standard lease in Maquoit Bay, and then further up the bay, so shallower and warmer, we have a few – like, six – LPAs as a company, and that's our nursery.  So, a bit warmer.  It's shallower, so there's a lot more nutrients that get kicked up from the bottom there.  Then we grow those out to a certain size, and then those are moved to the standard lease into cages.  We do solely floating cages and top surface culture.  So, yeah.


F:        [20:16] Thanks.


Q:        [20:18] Great.  Do you have any experience –?  You maybe mentioned this a little with the Salmon Sisters.  But do you have any experience with processing, marketing, trade?  


A:        [20:25] Let's see.  Marketing and trade and brand building – I have experience from Salmon Sisters.  They were phenomenal at brand-building.  Yeah, essentially just branding things out, and then direct to consumer – I had a lot of experience with that and just logistics behind distributing seafood products.  It's a little bit different with oysters because it's a live animal as opposed to flash-frozen seafood, but honestly, oysters are the perfect thing to ship.  They're already prepackaged, and it's quite crazy.  Seaweed, I don't have as much experience with, and I know that's exactly the bottleneck that they're running into in that industry.  Then, marketing – and then what was the first thing you asked?  Processing?  


Q:        [20:20] Processing.


A:        [20:21] Yeah, processing.  My experience with processing was only all of my experience as a fisheries observer, and then the land-based equivalent to that that I did in Northern California.  So, I would work in fish plants for half the time.  I was either on the boat or in a fish plant.  Sometimes, I had to live at the fish plant, depending on where I was on the islands.  Out in Akutan, you lived in the dorm at a seafood processing plant with all the plant processors.  


That was always a really cool experience because it is something that's not – I mean, it's a huge aspect of the industry, but people only think about the fishermen.  They don't really think about the land – sometimes, it's not even land-based; sometimes, they're out at sea – and what it's like to live in those situations.  That's pretty much the only place where you would see diversity in Alaska, which was fascinating, and that's also almost exclusively the place where I would work with women the most, as well.  I only worked on two boats out of the 30-something that I worked on that had women crew member.  So, that's more in my experience, but that would just be little bits and pieces that I would pick up while spending time in there.


Q:        [22:42] Sure.  What about food prep, consumer interface –?  Anything like that?


A:        [22:46] That I do have.  I've worked as a server, and I've done a bit of catering work as well, so I understand – I have had experience from sea to plate, essentially.  When I lived in California, I actually worked at a fish plant that we sold at the same restaurant that I worked at as well at night.  So, it was really cool.  I could point out – it was on the water, too, and I could point out the boats out on the water that were catching the rockfish that we were serving in our tacos.  That was a really cool full-circle aspect of it.  But I do have a bit of experience.  I'm not like a chef by any means.  I'm a decent at-home cook.  I love cooking seafood specifically.  


I always really enjoyed being a server, educating people about seafood industry, and that was – also, at Salmon Sisters, in the retail space, you would have to educate people on why wild seafood is important and knowing where your seafood come from.  It's not necessarily – in Alaska, they're very pro wild seafood, but that's a unique place because they have it all available, and it hasn't been fished for hundreds and hundreds of years, commercially, industrially, like the East Coast.  It's only been 40, 50 years there.  It’s more about the importance of knowing where your seafood comes from, and educating people that way was always a pretty enjoyable part of my job.


Q:        [24:12] Great.  Do you have any experience in advocacy, community-based organization related to fisheries or aquaculture?


A:        [24:19] Not directly.  I've never worked in the nonprofit sector before, but I've participated in grassroots efforts in Alaska a lot.  It's just part of the culture, naturally, which is really cool.  But because everybody is tied – even inland, everybody's tied to the fisheries.  So, a big one that we would participate in as a business, and then I would also help out personally, was Bristol Bay, the No Mines in Bristol Bay.  That was a big project that was ongoing in all my years in Alaska.  It's an ongoing effort, too, but that was just more a personal thing I was paying attention to rather than direct experience.


F:        [25:10] Is that the Pebble Mine?


A:        [25:11] Yeah, No Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay.  So, it's been ongoing.  The interest has floated from one foreign company to another, and you just have to keep up on it.  There's really cool efforts that have been going on for, like, 30 years in Alaska to fight the Pebble Mine, including music festivals and private companies doing their own thing or private businesses and family businesses doing their own grassroots effort.  It was effective because, at the time being, I think the Clean Water Act was (inaudible) there.  I want to say that it was like the final ruling.  That's a fascinating project and something that I still keep an eye on, even though I'm over in Maine now.


Q:        [26:02] Great.  Did you have another question?


F:        [26:04] Oh, no, I'm good.


Q:        [26:05] I'm curious if you could describe what an average day looks like for you now.


A:        [26:10] Sure.  So, it's summertime, so things are pretty – they're kicking up on the oyster farm, and because it gets so hot here now during the day as we start earlier.  So, I wake up at five.  I usually give myself an hour to get ready for the morning, and then I meet two other co-workers at the Back Cove parking lot, and we carpool up to Brunswick together.  So, that's great, helps on gas.  We usually get to work just before seven.  


I'm in charge of keeping the cooler temperatures, but that's purely because I'm the only one who remembers to do it. (laughter) The first thing I do when I get to work is report the cooler temperatures, which is important for a food safety aspect.  I think it's important.  Then, we usually get our assignment for the day.  So, since it's June and we have new seed on the farm, I usually head out with me – it's me, and then my co-nursery manager, Derek Devereaux, who's one of the families – part of the families that own Mere Point Oyster Company.  We head out, and we check on the little babies – they're so cute – and do any aspect of husbandry from there.  


So, generally speaking, most of it is tumbling, but washing the seed, flipping it, making sure that everything's aligned with the currents, and it's getting enough flow.  That's generally what we're doing until four or five.  So, usually in the summer, we work like five tens or five nines, and then we wrap up for the day, carpool back here to Portland, and then, generally speaking, either myself or my cousin, who's my roommate, will cook dinner.  Pretty lowkey.  I'm pretty boring when I get home at the end of the day.  It's hot, and I work all day.  I try and go for a walk, at least, if I'm feeling really healthy, and then it's back to it the next day.  


Q:        [28:16] Great.  Thank you.  How do you feel like your background or your identity shapes your work, including the way that you're maybe perceived, treated anything like that?


A:        [28:25] Yeah, that's something that I think about – I don't realize that I think about it, but I think about it more than what I even let myself on to.  I think specifically at the beginning, when I'm working on a new project, I just go above and beyond, and I have to prove it for myself, as well as prove it for other women out there.  It does feel like you have to represent whatever your group or your gender identity is as a whole, and that might be just personally imparted on me.  I feel that responsibility.  I'm sure if you talk to other – if you talk to some guy at my work, they would never think that, but I don't know if they are even thinking about that either.  


So, at first, I always work even harder than I think I could probably work, and everybody appreciates hard work, so proving myself in that way.  That being said also is, I have all the experience of working on the water for at least nine or 10 years before starting this new job.  Not everybody gets that opportunity.  It’s hard that you have to represent women as a whole.  But I also don't want to be the standard because there's so many other ways that a female on our team could help out.  That's not necessarily exactly what I do because of my experience.  


I do think about it.  Sometimes, the jobs that are given and assigned to me, I'm always like, “Is that because I'm a girl, or is that because I'm actually good at it?”  And then there was a time there – well, first of all, the winter is always just dark and hard to get through, especially February, March.  But I injured my rotator cuff – my bicep – in yoga, not even work related. (laughter) I started getting a lot more assignments that were not so physical.  It didn't really feel like I was helping the farm directly.  I was doing a lot more organization things, gear work.  So, I went through this tough time in the early spring and late winter of questioning, “Can women work in this industry?”  If I’m struggling right now, is that something that we have to change about the industry, or is that me?  


What I've ultimately realized is that you always need a resting period, first of all, and I just injured myself from overworking in general, but then also all those jobs that I was doing, even though I was the only one doing it, and I was the only girl doing it, they helped the farm immensely.  There were regulation things, like marking buoys that mark our standard leases, things that you have to be organized.  I don't know – organized and clean and concise.  Since I'm a woman, I actually am good at those things, so it does help the farm as a whole.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I do think about it more than what I thought I did.  Definitely.  


I think somebody spoke to me about this.  Actually. Annie Fagan.  They interviewed me for the Shared Waters program, which I took the Shared Waters program.  Sorry, I'm diverting right now that's online, it's free, and it's for everybody.  I did that in the winter that I first came here via Zoom, and then I also participated in the women's and non-binary specific one this last fall, in spring and winter.  They interviewed me for that, trying to figure out what women wanted from the program and how I felt about it.  That was only eight months ago, I would say, and I was like, “Oh, I don't really think about it at all.  La-di-da.”  But I realized this winter – I was like, “No, you do think about it more than you actually let on.”  


That was a really great program, and Annie did a phenomenal job with it.  I would say, at first, people online were upset, saying, “Why do we need separate spaces?  We should all be treated equally,” which I agree with.  But also, I will say that the second space that they made for us was 10 times better than the first.  I took away a lot more.  The networking was way better.  I actually made connections as opposed to the first one.  I think that we took away even more than the first one provided.  I think a separate space is really great as long as you integrate it with the actual industry.  I took a lot away from that.  I was a little upset when it ended, to be honest. (laughter)


F:        [33:25] Have you guys stayed in touch at all?  You said you built (inaudible) –? 


A:        [33:27] Yeah.  We have a WhatsApp that's been popping off.  Obviously, it's a busy season now, but I'm sure we'll get together as a group, and maybe next year when they do another class, they can have a reunion or some sort of party at some place, but they did a great job, truly.


Q:        [33:49] Great.  I'm curious, how do you feel your role in the sector interacts with any family or caregiving responsibilities you might have?  


A:        [33:55] Yeah.  I don't personally have any children, and I'm unmarried, but I do think my experience and my lifestyle before wasn't conducive to relationships unless you have somebody that – I don't know.  I mean, it's unconventional, I would say, the way that I've been living my life.  I really love my career.  So, I do think – I'm a classic millennial.  I've been putting everything into my work, which has questions in itself there.  It's difficult hours, but that being said, that's a huge reason why I got into aquaculture as opposed to wild fisheries and why I made that transition.  I'm 32 now, so that trajectory matches the more traditional way that people move through their life.  


So, I moved to aquaculture because you can still work on the water and make a living working really hard on the water, but you get to come home.  I take a shower every single day.  It's amazing.  I didn't get to do that when I worked on boats.  I was lucky if I got one every two weeks.  When I went fishing, the whole thing that we did all summer long was build a shower.  We didn't get to use it because we built it in the last week, but we built a shower.  So, being able to come home, have my cat – come home, have dinner with my cousin, take a shower – these are things that aquaculture can provide, but then also you get to work on the water and put in the nitty-gritty work.  That's a bit more conducive to being able to take care of a family or have a bit more of a traditional partnership, something like that. 


Q:        [35:45] Great.  Thank you so much.  I'm going to transition into questions about environmental change and your observations.  Feel free to reach into your Alaska experience, your Maine experience, whatever feels right.  Just make that clear for me.


A:        [35:56] Yes.


Q:        [35:58] So, just starting with, can you describe any changes in the marine environment that you've noticed?  


A:        [36:02] Yes, definitely, directly.  I have a science background, so I always want to be like, this is just observational rather than actually proven numbers.  But I think observational – observations from people who have worked on the water every single day are super important.  Even though it is somewhat objective, I think it's still really valid data.  My experience in Alaska, and another reason why I made this transition from wild fisheries to aquaculture, was the extractive aspect of everything just felt – I don't know.  It was getting to me, ultimately.  There's so much money going into the industry to make these boats top-end.  They can find fish anywhere.  


I always just question how sustainable that is in the long run, especially when we're moving into – they just shipped a 400-foot floating seafood processing plant to Bristol Bay.  It’s state-of-the-art.  Never been seen before.  Bristol Bay is such a contentious area because every year the fishermen are like, “We've had record catch.”  We had had record catch, and then the next year, “This is the most fish we've ever caught.”  


Meanwhile, you go up the river, and the Native Villages up there don't have any fish to feed themselves.  It’s not necessarily a direct – because I never actually fished in the bay, but that's one of the reasons why I never wanted to fish in the bay was I just don't necessarily think the regulation matched up to what is actually happening out there.  I was on the regulation side of things.  I was a fisheries observer for three years in Alaska.  Even in training, it was very much an “us versus” them mentality, which was really hard to grasp because I was like, it's an “us versus them,” but I'm living in their house for two weeks on end on their boat, in their house and their homes.  I can't treat them like other – or that we’re two separate entities.  I'm much more of a cooperative resource management – I prefer that style.  


So, it’s a reason why I've switched from fisheries to aquaculture because it felt a bit more – I don't know.  It just felt a bit more sustainable.  I think food security is a really big issue, obviously, globally, and so we need protein as a population as a whole.  So, the projects – and I think there's still a lot of money going into aquaculture, too, which is really cool, maybe just as much as wild fisheries.  So, just to bring these projects up to standard, I would like to see.  I've just seen that trend personally throughout my career.  


But direct environmental changes?  I'm new to Maquoit Bay, Maquoit Bay in Brunswick Maine, but this is my second year, so I've already even noticed the same patterns that are happening from last year, and when the fish come in and when the seals come in after it, and certain birds show up.  But this year, there’s far less eiders than I saw previous years or the last year, I should say.  There's less eider babies.  We had crazy mussel sets, which was unheard of last year, and that's because the blue mussels don't like being in the intertidal zone right now because it's too warm, so they were going deeper.  They set all over our gear.  So that was a trend that I've noticed that is a bit more environmental.  


In the bay that we work in, there's very little eel grass left, and that is cyclical, as we learn from science, but there's a ton of private residences in that area that, as much as aquaculture is regulated – and that was a cool thing about being in Maine, is that it's regulated in Maine.  I mentioned earlier how you have to get your seed from Maine.  It's regulated by the state of Maine.  All the businesses have to be in Maine, whereas in Alaska, that was getting regulated from Washington, from Seattle.  That sort of disconnected – it was a disconnect from the place that you're regulating.  


So, I think Maine is really inspiring that way.  Although, Maine does move slow.  They can't really pivot in these ways.  I think that's kind of a Mainers – I don't know.  It's a quality of being a Mainer is that you take the information in slowly.  But the thing is, is that climate change is happening fast, so it's hard for businesses to reconcile the two, the slow-moving and the philosophy on regulation in Maine, and then what you need to do as a business to pivot.  That’s been interesting because it's moving way faster in the Gulf of Maine than it is most places in the world, maybe second to Alaska.  It's just interesting to notice the changes but then also see the similarities between Alaska and Maine and how they deal with climate change in general.


Q:        [41:50] Yeah.  How are  – I'm curious –these differences in species you're seeing maybe between years impacting your work?  But also, how do you feel this conflict between regulation timing and the timing of nature –?  How do you feel like that's impacting your work?  


A:        [42:08] Yeah.  Our business is at a unique point scaling as well.  We’re the third largest in the state right now.  We have a lot of attention on us as well.  It’s been hard for us to pivot based off of what the regulations are.  I understand both sides of things.  From the business standpoint, if you were a farm, a land-based farm, you would be able to just buy whatever equipment that you needed to buy to fix the new weed that is growing or the new Asian jumping worm that's in your garden, or something like that.  But in aquaculture, you have to go through these regulations because we’re leasing our area from the public trust.  It's not our water.  It's nobody's water.  It's barely even the state of Maine’s water.  It’s a unique thing that businesses – if you're looking to start a business in aquaculture, it's just something that you should take into account.  


I will say it's a bit frustrating because all eyes are on us.  Also, all the eyes are on DMR.  They're under a really immense amount of stress.  If one farm does something wrong, it could affect all the farms throughout Maine.  But climate change is affecting everything really quickly.  And then on top of that, if you aren't here year-round, or if you're not on the water year-round, it's easy for second homers to come in here in the summer and be a loud voice and put the pressure on.  I think that's just part of being in a democracy sometimes, is that that's something that you have to deal with.  But it's really hard to – it's hard for me to come at it from an understanding standpoint because they're not here every single day.  We're on the water every single day.  Even in the winter when it's icing over, even when there's a thunderstorm yesterday, we're the ones on the water.  


It’s hard not to feel that ownership on the space in the waters that we're leasing from the state because we do – I think it's always a balance of – when people get emotional, or they feel like ownership over these things, I think it's always important to just remember that they care.  It’s just that they really care about it.  But I think also maybe they just need to have their voice be heard, and that's it.  You don't really have to take action upon it.  


Second homers – it's a really big thing in Brunswick.  They don't pay taxes to the town.  The company pays plenty of taxes to the town.  So, it's always a question of go where the money is or whatnot.  But Brunswick is a very unique town in that way, more than other places in Maine that we've been dealing with.  The social license of aquaculture is something that could use some work in a lot of places in Maine.  Some places, it's – in Damariscotta River, there's tons of social license.  People identify with being by oyster farms all the time, but where we are at, we're considered an eyesore or a disruption to the peace, which is interesting because we’re just trying to make money and work on the water.  Mostly just trying to make a living for ourselves.  


It’s kind of interesting.  Although Maine is a really small state, and you're one degree separated from pretty much everyone, the fact that there's so much variation in social licensing with oyster farms or with aquaculture throughout the state is interesting.  The impacts of that, I'm not sure.  I know DMR is dealing with it.  I know our company is dealing with that.  Just getting pressure from external sources that have a bit more money than either entity has.


F:        [46:15] Can I ask a follow-up?  Circling back to – I'm just thinking – you elaborated on some of those in a really helpful way, but a little more about the blue mussel biofouling, how that issue impacts your work or work of the company?  


A:        [46:31] Yeah.  That was new last year when I came in.  They're just discovering that that was a huge issue.  They had a set in the fall that was not taken care of until late spring, and at that point, mussels grow so quickly.  They're like weeds of the ocean.  They grow so fast, but they're not as durable as oysters, so you can get rid of them, but it takes a lot of work.  They set all over our gear, all over the cages, into bags because it's tiny, tiny, so it could – luckily, it didn't get in any seed bag because it was in the fall, but it got into all the bags.  What we had to do in the spring was figure out how to mitigate these mussels while not also spreading them back into our farm.  


So, we first – what did we do? – tried excessive flipping, but then it got too warm to do that too aggressively.  We have a tumbler.  We started hand shaking – every single bag, we would just slam the shit out of it, break it up, and then we would shake the oysters by hand, and hopefully the mussels would release.  That took a ton of manpower.  We pretty much threw every strong high schooler and college student that we hired that summer onto that.  It was messy.  It was hot.  It was hard work.  So then we realized, as a business, we can't solely depend on that.  How can we pivot?  That being said, you can't – per regulations, you're unable to add a new machine to your lease, or a new boat, or even a new dock, or something like that, to your lease without getting it approved by DMR.  


So, we're actively trying to mitigate these mussels that are growing a quarter inch a month and also spawning and growing more mussels every five months.  But we're unable to add a new machine to our process because it has to go through the entire amendment process.  It's really difficult for a business to catch up to a problem that they're currently dealing with.  But then we also can't add anything without DMR’s approval, which was specific to blue mussels.  It wasn't just our farm.  It was pretty much – every farm in Casco Bay got hit with blue mussels.  


We've gotten on top of it.  They spawned again in the spring, but we were able to do it – we caught it really, really early and were able to do a couple of flips.  For the most part, those baby mussels are dead, and we're dealing with the last couple strings of some mussels – and the mussels that caused us issues last fall and last spring, right now, if we didn't get to that bag, the mussels are this big right now.  They're a full three inches, bigger than Bangs Island mussels.  We're really good at growing mussels, too, but we would prefer to focus on the oyster growing. (laughter) 


The mussels took a huge hit, and also, they stress out the oysters.  It's not just a hard thing to deal with.  They do threaten our product.  So, they stress the mussels.  They compete with nutrients.  They can compete for space.  So, then our oysters grow in funny shapes.  There's a business side or the market side of things that you don't want the mussels – and then, even on the processing side, it took our orders at least a couple hours longer to get through completely because you would have to pick every mussel off because we don't want mussels going to our restaurants or our wholesale accounts.  So, it affected us on the water.  It affected us on land with processing and everything, too.  


Also, at one point, we did an excessive flip, a more aggressive flip, during the warmer months, and then the oysters were under stress.  We actually had large – because with the flip, we were trying to get rid of the mussels.  But then there was also a virus that was in the water that killed off, surprisingly, more of our market oysters, our older oysters.  So, even from a business standpoint and having enough inventory to cover us through the fall and the winter, the mussels were a huge hit to us as a business.  


Luckily, we live, and we learn.  We've gotten ahead of it at this point, but we're still really limited.  We are limited in dock space.  We need more space to do this.  We can't add more docks because our lease doesn't allow it.  We could use another tumbler, but we're not allowed another tumbler without getting that approved.  There's a couple – there’s this machine that we got, which is a shaker.  It's used for smaller oysters to grade those out.  But then we've realized that that's actually really good for getting rid of mussels as well.  You can rub it all over it.  It's like a cheese grater.  That works really great, but we're not allowed to bring that on the water because it's not approved.  So, what we have to do is bring oyster bags onto land, get them in a cooler, shake them, get them back in a cooler, get them in the water.  


Pretty much every time you bring oysters onto land, or you do any sort of handling like that, you can expect a 20% loss.  So, every time we do that, you can calculate a 20% loss with that, which is, if we were able to do it on the water, would be less.  Yeah, it was a really big issue.  But yeah, again, we've kind of lived and learned.  We got ahead of it this time, so we'll see.  Then there's going to be a new species that pops up.  So, who knows?  It could be barnacles.  Barnacles are getting more and more up here, which they deal with a lot down south in warmer waters.  You can get a huge barnacle set, and it would be equivalent to mussels, but they cut you constantly. (laughter) So yeah, it'll just be a new species that's kind of trickling its way up as the waters get warmer.


Q:        [53:11] So you described some of the adaptations and changes with the mussels that you're seeing.  Are there any other adaptations you're making in response to environmental change on the farm?  Any other ways you're thinking about that there?  


A:        [53:24] Yeah, let's see.  I would say we're taking into account water temperatures a lot more.  We're keeping a lot closer eye on that.  We don't want to stress out the oysters.  They're really heat resistant, luckily, but, in general speaking, we grow Northern Eastern oysters.  It's all the same species throughout the eastern seaboard, but ours are more cold water – used to that.  I think we're keeping track of temperatures a lot more, which is important for our nursery, and then it's also important for our flip schedule, making sure that we don't stress it out before, perhaps, a big kind of virus, or an algal bloom or something like that.  We don't have any other kind of data receiving entities –we use these little HOBO loggers that are like a thermostat or thermometer.  


Overall, as a company – as a state, we're currently under a vibrio watch, or the vibrio mitigation plan maybe is the more official term.  As of June 1, the whole state is underneath that, whereas previous years, it was only two or three places throughout the state, but the DMR decided it was much more responsible to put the whole state underneath that.  


Fortunately, our company was already doing a lot of vibrio control plans prior to that regulation catching up.  We were pretty much set up for it.  June 1 was not a hard transition for us.  But I know a lot of smaller companies have had to change a lot of things, and we are fortunate because we're a larger company.  Smaller companies, not so much.  Ice is really expensive, setting up cooler spaces is really expensive.  We have a ton of solar panels on our barns.  We barely pay for electricity as a company.  That was something that they did many, many years ago.  If you're trying to implement that now, it would take months.  


So, we're fortunate because we're big.  That's pretty much what it is – with the new vibrio plan.  But it makes a lot of sense.  Vibrio sounds very scary.  It's really not that scary.  It's a naturally occurring bacteria.  We worked with a UMaine grad student last summer, and she was doing this really cool project.  Within the vibrio family, there's, we'll say, 30-something strains, but only three of them are detrimental to humans – could actually makes humans sick.  The current vibrio plan is (inaudible) – the current vibrio plan is that if you are in a vibrio area that's shut down for having it being present, you have to test until that level is low enough.  But what this cool grad student was trying to figure out is if we can test for that specific pathogenic vibrio, the vibrio that would make people sick upon consumption, and so then that way, farms could test out of the vibrio a bit easier.  


I think they use RNA/DNA testing in the water, and then they can determine if the vibrio present is just vibrio.  That's just a natural bacteria that is in tons of places, or it's something that can make people sick.  That's kind of cool how we're using the academic and science side of things.  She also worked with DMR on this project to update the regulations and not have it be such a hard hammer, kind of give a little bit of leeway to the farmers.


F:        [57:29] Is that nuance being distinguished now in practice?


A:        [57:31] I think she's running the numbers now.  She had three test sites.  I want to say one was in Scarborough, which was a river that was previously under a vibrio control plan.  She had our test site, which is – we kind of represent Casco Bay, but we're on the northern side of it, so we're not close to Portland, where runoff events affect us as much.  Then, they tested a farm up in Damariscotta, which was the other place that they had a vibrio control plan.  I think they're comparing the three.  She's probably running through that data right now.  It'll probably be a little bit before that kicks in, but at least they're looking towards and working with those projects to make it a bit easier for businesses to function as things are changing.


Q:        [58:19] Yeah.  You mentioned the size of the farm and also this work being done.  I'm curious if there's anything else that you feel like your farm is really drawing on to be able to adapt.  Some words that might spark things: resources, relationships, knowledge, training, organization.


A:        [58:33] Yeah.  I mean, all those things, for sure.  We are at a scaling point where we have some leveraging ability in a good and bad way.  All eyes are on us, so that can be hard.  But then, that being said, we can represent farms as a whole, and we're still a family-owned and operated farm even though we are larger.  It's still owned by two families.  Both their sons work every single day on the farm.  Excuse me.  All four sons – two sons from each family.  We can kind of represent these smaller farms.  They only started with a few LPAs in 2016, so it's a young company.  We can represent these smaller farms while also having the leverage that a larger farm can.  But that being said, it's hard to be a big farm and also be a small farm and a small business, in a way.  


But resources – we work really closely with DMR as much as possible.  We worked with that UMaine grad student last year.  Relationships.  We have a good working relationship with most farms in the area, I would say.  That's kind of the cool thing about aquaculture in Maine in general, as opposed to maybe my wild fishery experience in Alaska.  Up there, they're not super willing to help other people out.  You work for your own boat or your own company, and you're trying to meet your quota.  Whereas in aquaculture, in Maine, even when I first moved here, I was getting the feeling that everybody just sort of wants to help each other out.  Rising tide lifts all boats.  Everybody's all about putting people into contact with somebody that's experienced the same issue.  We have farm tours.  We have people come to our farm all the time that are checking out our Tumbler system because that's solar-powered as well.  We designed that so we could – we give the design to other people that might want to use a similar system.  


I think it's really important to maintain relationships, especially as things are changing because a farm that's further south than us could warn us that something might hit us a little bit further north, and vice versa.  Also, we marketing – a bit of marketing experience and a following on Instagram, so we can help other farms or other businesses around us sort of gain leverage and gain some popularity in that way as well, which, I think – yeah, just maintaining the relationships in the scope of climate change is really important just because all farms are dealing with the same thing, essentially, because waters are warming, and it's not just affecting one bay more than another.


Q:        [1:01:33] Yeah, great.  As you look towards the future, are there any adaptations that you really hope the farm makes, any things that you think are going to be really important?


A:        [1:01:42] I think the move towards solar is really great.  There’s tons of grants and stuff like that that are floating around that can help businesses – I don't know – implement that a bit more.  We have plenty of solar on our land-based operation and then also in the water.  There's a ton of single-use plastic that's used in aquaculture as a whole.  We help people with cage design, things like that.  But that's not just like the things that we use on the water.  Even your gear has plastic.  Grundéns is all plastic or the boots that you wear, and then everything that we use, from – tens of thousands of bags that we have are plastic.  That’s just something that I'm concerned about.  I know there's a lot of projects that are going on.  The Myco Buoys are super cool.  I've been hearing about those.  Even Alaska people were talking about Myco Buoys.  I think that's fascinating.  


I do wonder – the scalability of everything because our farm is so big.  If I ultimately have my own personal farm, I would like to implement a ton more sustainable materials.  I know there's some cool farms that are further up north, closer to Bar Harbor, that are fully plastic-free, which I think is phenomenal.  I just don't think that's scalable to the farm size that we run right now.  It would be interesting to see – maybe bioplastics would be cool.  


Oh, there is actually a really cool project, too.  So, the mussels being an issue, and just biofouling, in general, I think there's some project going on – somebody's diving into it – of essentially like a kelp-based coating system.  You could spray it on the bottom of your boat.  You could potentially spray it all over your cages or your gear or something.  Because if you ever look at seaweed or wild kelp, nothing's ever growing on it.  There's maybe some bryozoans and maybe a snail or two, but nothing holds on to the kelp.  So, if they could come up with this sort of spray or something – it's not even bottom paint.  It would go on top of everything.  That would coat everything.  Then, the bio-fouling wouldn't be so much of an issue.  It would kind of just slough off.  How that would be implemented I have no idea.  I'm not a research and development – I'm more of an ideas girl, but I think these projects are really cool, and there's a ton of money going into different aquaculture.  


I always think of aquaculture as food-based.  That's where my mind is always at, is food, but the kelp projects and more of an industrial – as more of an industrial product or ingredient is fascinating, but Maine as a whole probably doesn't grow enough kelp to sustain that industrial thing.  You might have to look to Alaska for that.  I think there's tons of really cool projects out there, but what will actually take hold and what's scalable to a farm that's as big as ours is a whole other issue.


Q:        [1:05:04] Yeah.  When you're looking towards the future, what is your biggest concern for Maine's fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [1:05:11] I think it's a balance of being able to pivot and having to change how you're running your business based off of the curve balls that climate change is throwing at you.  But then also that being said, I'm pro-regulation and keeping an eye on things because businesses, if they just go unregulated, we've seen where that goes as a whole.  So, I think it's a balance between the two things, and finding that balance is, again, a whole other – it's a much deeper issue than I'm able to speak on.  But I do think becoming more sustainable as a whole – so going to single plastics – I don't know.  Even how we ship things, like logistics of that, I think is really important because just shipping and logistics is a whole other side of industries that – it's major.  


If we want to do direct-to-consumer, which you get a higher profit yield out of it, there's a bit more of a spread there.  Then you have to rely on logistics, which is a whole other thing.  I think solar is really cool and using less gas-based products would be neat.  But I haven't heard of anybody that really likes any of the electric motors.  So, that's a whole other thing in itself.  Also, where are you getting the electricity from when you're plugging it in?  


As a whole, I'm always a bit more sustainably conscious.  I think pretty much everybody on our team is, even if they don't really even know that they are when we're picking up trash in the bay.  We're constantly picking up after just – the things that we find in the bay is crazy sometimes.  It’s – I don't know – birthday balloons and just the random stuff.  They don't realize that they actually are more climate-minded than what they would let on to.  We also have a really great supervisor at our farm, and he's always pretty conscientious and wants to implement as many more sustainable things.  But also, it's always hard as a business because it's like a cost analysis thing.  


As a state as a whole, Dana Morse is doing really great stuff.  He has his own – I think it's a personal project himself.  He likes to update everybody in the area about cool, new, plastic-free products – things like that.  Again, going back to the community and relationships that helps a ton.  


Q:        [1:07:59] Yeah.  If you could tell policymakers, “This should be your biggest priority,” when you look towards the future, with respect to aquaculture, fisheries, and the environment, what would you tell them?


A:        [1:08:09] I would say, listen to your farmers.  Listen to the people who are on the ground doing it, rather than – I think that there's tons of other entities and nonprofits and academia that help and can voice all these ideas and can study it through and through and put these big words into it.  But your farmers are the ones who are out there dealing with it, and everybody likes – it's the same with land-based agriculture.  Everybody wants the food.  Everybody wants the really nice product, the organic product, or whatnot, the most sustainable one, but nobody ever wants the farmers.  Nobody ever listens to the people who are actually growing it.  I think just listen to your farmers.  Get to know them a little bit more.  Get out on the water yourself instead of being removed from the resource and removed from this thing that you're managing.  Also, a lot more cooperative effort instead of a top-down regulatory attitude.  I think just working together only ever going to help.  Excuse me.  


Q:        [1:09:25] Great.  Thank you.  Sort of transitioning, have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training for fishing or aquaculture in Maine? 


A:        [1:09:35] Sorry.  One sec.  Can I get you guys a seltzer or anything?


F:        [1:09:41] I would take one.


Q:        [1:09:42] I’d take one as well.


F:        [1:09:43] It’s so hot.  Thank you.


A:        [1:09:44] They’re pineapple.  It’s so weird. 


Q:        [1:09:45] Oh my gosh, thank you.


F:        [1:09:46] Thank you.


A:        [1:09:50] (Katherine with tears) [a]Here you go.  I just got a little tickle.  I’m so emotional on climate change.


F:        [1:09:56] Yeah (laughter) Make sure to put that parentheses – Kat with tears.


A:        [1:10:01] Tears. (laughter)


F:        [1:10:02] Goes to fridge. 


A:        [1:10:03] Goes to tears.  Needs a seltzer. (laughter) Can you repeat your last question?


Q:        [1:10:08] Yes, of course.


A:        [1:10:09] Thank you.


Q:        [1:10:10] Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training for the fishing or aquaculture industry?


A:        [1:10:15] Hmm.  I don't think so, not directly, honestly.  I guess I've just picked up from – sorry, guys. (coughs) I don't know where this came from.  I don't think directly, honestly.  We've picked up a little bit from the aquaculture webinars that I participated in.  Then, I don't know.  I just feel maybe the social media algorithm has figured me out when I get pushed these articles, and they know I'm interested in it, so it’s just a personal learning project.  But other than that, I don't know if there's many resources for farms or farmers to directly reach out and learn from and put in the stuff that they are seeing directly.  


I guess I would be kind of going back to the cooperative sort of things.  The farmers see it.  They can observe everything, but they may not understand the grander scheme behind things.  So, molding the academia or the farmers and allowing them to understand what they're seeing as opposed to just being observations and vice versa.  I mean, it helps the academia as well.  Without a cause or – there's a really great quote out there that I'll totally botch, but – data without a heart, or data without like a human story is just numbers and vice versa.  Observations without data or without numbers or explanation is just a story.  


I think just molding those things together, which is where I'm most passionate about because I do have an academic background and a scientific background, but I also love being out there on the water and doing the actual farm work.  Personally, I would like to see more of that, I think, bridging those two.


Q:        [1:12:34] Yeah.  You touched on this a lot, but if there's anything else you want to add, what other strategies do you think would be effective in helping build resilience in Maine's aquaculture industry?


A:        [1:12:45] Yeah, so I touched on that a little bit, but a more cooperative management style, which you can look to other countries.  It doesn't even have to be ocean-based policy or anything like that.  A lot of land management policies are moving more towards a cooperative stance on things, as opposed to just regulation coming from top down.  I think a little bit of – not even leniency – flexibility with regulations and being able to do that, and that also could just be a staffing issue, something beyond anybody's understanding on the outside, but a little bit of flexibility would allow farms to meet the demand while also dealing with climate change and functioning without bogging down the state essentially.  


That being said – and I just really don't think any of the farms – this is personal, but a little bit of flexibility – I don't think anybody's going to be taking advantage of it.  Again, everybody's looking out for each other.  They all work together.  I think giving farms a bit of flexibility in that way, it's not going to spiral out of control like one would do on the land, or something like that.  Again, we are still just leasing it from the public trust.  There's only so much you can do.  It's not even a permanent thing.  You have to go back every 10 years and be reassessed.  I think that would help a lot.  


Education.  I'm not sure.  I think it's also education of the public, not just education of the farms.  I think a lot of people are scared when they hear the term aquaculture.  I, myself, was even one of those people when I was living in a place that was like purely wild fish, wild-caught propaganda.  That was what Alaska pushes.  But that makes sense in Alaska.  It doesn't necessarily make sense elsewhere.  


I know people who are gunning for changing wording, rebranding aquaculture.  Mariculture is always floated around, which I think is interesting.  I don't always think rebranding is the correct answer.  There’s enough marketing out there in the world.  I think it's also just public education, and that can help the industry as a whole.  I think that’s, in part, the industry's responsibility, too.  It's not for other people to do.  It's on us because once people get to know the farmers and get to know these businesses, they'll have a tie to it, and they would be much more open to eating farm-raised seafood or an aquaculture product from Maine.  


We do farm tours at our business.  They're really fun.  Going back to me educating the public about where their food comes from, I get to do a few of them throughout the summer.  People's response is it’s always so much fun.  Nobody's ever seen an oyster farm, but they've eaten oysters.  They have no idea where it comes from.  Just bringing them out there and giving them the full five cents experience really ties them to the place and the product.  Tying them to the product, which is then tied to the place, they might be more concerned about it in the long run for climate change and how that might affect it.  Yeah.  Just education, working together – simple concepts. (laughter)


Q:        [1:16:36] Great.  I'm curious.  Are there any other changes you're seeing, maybe not environmental, not related to social license that you want to tell us about?


A:        [1:16:43] I suppose.  I mean, there's changes just the way that business and – I don't know – just the way the world runs, like corporations stepping in and buying out smaller farms, which is good and bad, in a lot of senses.  They can provide higher pay and health benefits.  But also, that means that it's not a locally owned business.  I can foresee that happening a lot more in the industry, and that is something that, as a state or just as an industry, we have to figure out.  I think it's kind of the natural progression of being in the economic world that we live in now.  


I've always just been very pro-small – I've almost exclusively worked for small businesses since I was 16.  I just think that there's something special about working for a small business, even though it's craziness and disorganized, and nobody ever really knows the answer.  But I think that's the beauty of it all, as opposed to – that being said, you can get things done quicker when it's in a small business, as opposed to it being a corporation.  That might hurt people in the long run, if they're not able to change quickly, especially if that corporation is in Canada or somewhere that's not Maine.  Again, not place-based and community-based like all these things used to be.  I could see that affecting the industry as a whole in Maine.  


Also, again, I mentioned this a little bit earlier, but although aquaculture is big in Maine, and we do have some larger farms, they're still, on a global scale, considered micro-farms.  There are farms that are acres and square miles large in Africa and China and in Canada and Ireland, plenty of places.  I think it's always kind of funny when Maine is – it's a little bit insular – insulated, and they're comparing and being like, “Well, that farm’s huge.  That's a factory farm.”  Plenty of people call our farm factory farms, which is ridiculous.  I'll just say it's ridiculous. (laughter) They have no idea the actual scale that things are grown on in the world, and that's maybe where we need to go towards, or we just need to accept that it's only ever going to be small-scale farms in Maine, but that means that we may not be doing industrial-sized operations in this state, and that's fine.  There's other places that you can do that, and it might be more like socially aware or accepted.  


I think it's really funny when people are like, “That's a factory farm.  That farm is huge.”  We have 16 acres at our farm.  We only use 12 of them.  And people call us a factory farm.  And I was like, “You have no idea.  This is very small scale.”  We only have nine full-time employees.  It’s using that super-weighted language that, again, is just a loud minority that's being loud and putting the pressure on us and the state.  But in the large context of things, Maine is a blip.  But you can learn a lot from just a small-scale sort of organization or industry.  I don't know.  It’s an interesting intersection of all of it.


Q:        [1:20:50] Can you tell me about any real positive change you've seen or opportunity?


A:        [1:20:54] Going the main part of the interview is there are more women involved on a farming level rather than on the processing or land side of things.  I want to say I saw some stat that 40 or 50% of license holders of LPAs in Maine, which is the smaller license you can hold, are female or nonbinary, which I think is amazing.  I think just having that equality, a bit more like that gendered equality, can only lift up the industry as a whole because it is – it's backbreaking work.  Nothing about aquaculture is ergonomic whatsoever. You are hauling all the time.  But that being said, you don't have to be the strongest person in order to be a successful oyster farmer.  There's tons of tools, and again, there's tons of money going into making things easier that can really – yeah, it opens the door for more women or nonbinary, or a bit more – not just like brute and brawn.  That being said, it makes it easier on the men as well.  They shouldn't be breaking their backs, either.  It's only just good improvements overall.  I think that's really – yeah, that's a positive change that I've been seeing.  


I think that consumers are a bit more – that is trending is that farm-raised used to be really red-flagged.  I think that consumers are now realizing they just need to know where their seafood is from.  It's not necessarily one is worse than the other.  It's just more about knowing where your food come from.  I think consumers are getting more – they're smarter now.  They're asking the right questions.  That's definitely a trend that I'm seeing that I think can only be a positive.  


I don't know.  I think the research side of things, too.  They're starting to do more projects that are climate change-based.  Some of the hatcheries that we work with, I know they're working on more warm-water-resistant brood stock.  So, they're choosing who is spawning and who are the mother and father of that batch.  They're choosing those based on their ability to withstand certain temperature variation.  That would help the farms, in the long run, being able to work with the changing water temperatures.  Clearly, it's on the academic side, but seeing one that will trickle down a bit more to the actual farms will be interesting.  But it's definitely on the forefront of everybody's minds.  


Q:        [1:24:08] Great.  And then my last question: what is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's fisheries and aquaculture?  


A:        [1:24:14] Hopeful.  I guess I hope that it would be a bit more of a cooperative industry.  It already is, but I see room for improvement.  I like the trend of less single-use plastics, and I think ultimately, with the right amount of money going into research and things like that, that would be available.  It is pretty regenerative already as an industry.  So, I think emphasizing that would be making it even more so.  That would be really helpful.  I don't know.  


I guess maybe just, all in all, people not being afraid to eat raw oysters.  I do sometimes take it personally when people are like, “I would never eat that raw,” with ultimate disdain in their voice.  I'm like, “You don't have to say it like that.  You could just say, ‘I don't prefer it.’”  I think I would be really hopeful for people to actually try raw oysters more because everybody that I've given my oysters to have previously never ate raw oysters are all converts.  I think, hopefully, more people would enjoy raw oysters.  That would be really nice because they've really changed my life.  So, I think it would be cool to change other people's lives, too.


Q:        [1:25:47] Great.  Thank you.  Is there anything else you want to share with us before we end the interview?  


A:        [1:25:50] No, but thank you so much.  This was great.


Q:        [1:25:52] Yeah, of course.


F:        [1:25:54] I have a few small (inaudible) questions.  


A:        [1:25:55] Yes, please.


F:        [1:25:46] I was just curious.  You talked about different species showing up and different species that are pests or things you have to manage.  I was just curious.  We have heard some of this, and I was wondering if it influences your work on the farm.  Is green crabs – if you have any observations that (inaudible) green crabs?


A:        [1:26:13] Yeah.  They're definitely present.  We really only deal with them at the beginning, in the spring, when we raise all our cages.  In the winter, we fill all the pontoons with water.  We sink them down to the bottom for three or four months, depending on ice and water temperatures.  This winter, we actually didn't really have any issues, so ultimately sinking – we didn't need to sink the farm.  But you never know.  When we raise the cages, they'll be filled with green crabs.  Fortunately, we haven't noticed any detrimental aspects of that with our oysters.  They crowd the cages, and they're a bit of a pest.  


Where we do have issues with green crabs is that – so, our bay is – it used to be one of the most – I don't know – prolific and highest yield shellfish bays for clams, specifically.  So, when we have to go to meetings for – let's say we have a new dock that was proposed.  We get a lot of pushback from the diggers, the clam diggers, because their product and their resource is really, really threatened right now, and they're actively getting beaches shut down.  My heart goes out to the clam diggers.  But they don't know where to point a finger, and it's easiest to point a finger at an oyster farm than an invasive species.  


Currently, we're dealing with trying to educate clam diggers that our floating oyster farm is not taking – their argument is that we're taking all the nutrients from the bay, which is – that bay has really high turnover.  It's super shallow.  It has a ton of upwelling.  There's plenty of nutrients.  We're just trying to educate – we're not the ones who are threatening your livelihood or your resource.  Honestly, the green crabs and then the climate change and the warming waters are the biggest threat to clams right now.


Also, they've been a pretty poorly managed resource, as well.  If you look at the landing numbers, it's crazy.  You could just look at the landing numbers and see the trends.  Green crabs ourselves are not an issue, but that's just because we do top culture for the most part, which is fortunate,  But then we have mussels on top culture, so it's a pick your –


F:        [1:28:52] Avoiding one (inaudible).  


A:        [1:28:53] Yeah, exactly.  


F:        [1:28:54] So, you’re just picking them out of the cages when you lift them in the Spring.


A:        [1:28:56] We pick them out of the cages when we lift them, and then sometimes they'll still be one in a bag that we didn't get to.  I always try and give them – personally, I try and give them a quick death, just punch them out, and that's that.  But some people throw them back.  We had a new girl training, and I was like, “Oh, that's invasive.  Normally, we kill them.”  She was like, “Oh.”  And I was like, “You don't have to, though.  You can just throw it back if you're not comfortable with that.”  She’s like, “OK.”  So, she just threw it back.


F:        [1:29:21] They’re not predation.


A:        [1:29:22] They’re not pred –


F:        [1:29:23] Predation isn’t the issue.  It’s a space issue.


A:        [1:29:25] Yeah, no, they’re not – supposedly, when the oysters are small enough, they might, but we have never had a green crab in our in our spat bags, in our small packs.  Knock on wood.  That's not an issue.  I know that it affects a lot of other farms.  It's definitely affecting the clam diggers the most out of everybody.  


F:        [1:29:47] And then, one more follow-up question, which was just, I was just wanting to make sure I have understood you well and that this is a fair characterization.  I think your comments and thoughts about the scale question of a farm is really interesting, and looking within Maine versus outside of Maine, of course, scale is – according to what?  


A:        [1:30:07] Yeah, exactly.


F:        [1:30:09] Is it big or small?  But within Maine, it's a big, but family-owned farm.  Still rather small, as you’ve noted.  I was just curious – we've talked to a lot of smaller farmers, and you made some – I was just thinking about scale impacts adaptation and wondering if it's a fair characterization to say that it seems like, as a bigger farm, you all have been able to perhaps have the assets to be able to invest in making some changes, but maybe are a little bit –?  Do you feel like it's fair that at that scale, though, it's a little limited in the flexibility, the ability to make short-term changes?  Or do you think not so much?  Because I know small farms have the flexibility aspect.  They don't have to check out with anyone to make a change, but they may not have the assets.  So, I don't know.  I just wanted to see if you could comment on that and make sure I'm understanding the difference or characterization well. 


A:        [1:31:02] Totally, yeah.  I think that's a fair assessment as well.  We're large enough where we have the financial ability to invest in these things, and also, our owners are more than willing to throw money at a machine that might just make things easier.  That being said, we also – if something were to happen, the amount of oysters that we would have to get through in order to make it not a problem anymore is at a scale that smaller farmers don't need to do.  We buy – how many?  I think we're set for three million seed this year.  We have 1.1 so far.  That's just seed alone, within early June.  It helps that you're bigger because you have the finances to pay for things and the backing for that.  But then also, we can't just get rid of a problem quickly.  


It has to be a full scale – which is actually – it’s pretty funny that I work for this company now too, because in my previous company, it's a small business, but when you're in that middle ground where you're not a full-blown corporation, but you're still a small business, you're held to these standards of a large business.  You're held to these – people are looking at you like you're a large business, but we're really just a small, family-owned business that is a little bit larger than the other LPAs or a smaller farm in Maine.  Yeah.  You can hide behind being a small business, but then you can also hide behind being a larger business too.  I think scaling is just interesting to me as a whole.  There's definitely benefits of just remaining small, and then there's obvious benefits for the growth and the scaling up.  So, kind of a catch-22, I think.


F:        [1:33:10] Interesting.  Thank you so much.


A:        [1:33:12] Of course.  Thank you.


Q:        [1:33:13] Great.  I’ll go ahead and turn this off.  


END OF FILE


[a]Just double checking this is okay to add, since it is explicitly said in the next lines."
"16","Q:        [0:00] We just usually like to start with how you like to introduce yourself.  


A:        [0:05] Hi, my name is Amanda Lyons.  I'm an intertidal fisherman.


Q:        [0:09] Thank you.  And what year were you born?


A:        [0:11] 1987.


Q:        [0:14] Great.  Thank you.  Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:17] I grew up in New Haven – well, New Haven, Connecticut.  I grew up on Long Island Sound, doing recreational RV-style boating.  We used to travel around to Block Island and Newport and different places.  Me and my dad, we took a trip all the way down to the Carolinas by boat.  That was awesome.  I just fell in love with it.  When I was in high school, I went to the Sound School, which is a regional vocational aquaculture school, so kind of like the Eastport Boat School, but it was a full-blown high school and worked on boats, learned how to fiberglass, did all kinds of things.  Then, when one of my classmates, who was a year older than me, graduated, she came up to UMM, she's like, “You got to go check out this school because it's just like a college version of our high school.”  That’s how I ended up in Maine.  


Q:        [1:15] Great.  Thank you.  Can you tell me a little bit more about your experience in high school and at UMM?


A:        [1:20] Sound School was fantastic.  It’s set up to literally cover aquaculture and agriculture.  We also had an ag program.  It was funded by Future Farmers of America and other sponsorships.  The first couple years, they introduced you to both the science and the tech side of the marines.  Then, once you hit your senior year, you got to choose science or tech.  But my senior year, there wasn't enough kids, so they allowed us to do both.  I took finfish culture.  I learned how to spawn oysters.  I was doing experiments with chain dogfish.  We were trying to do embryonic development, and we cut them out of their casing, put them in petri dishes, and was developing the growth.  Unfortunately, their gestation is like 10 months, so I only got to finish half of it, and then I had to let another class take it over. (laughter) So, it was very hard to let go.  


We learned how to row.  We learned how to sail.  I was on the rowing team.  We used to compete against all kinds of different schools and adults.  Our biggest competition – go figure – was Vinalhaven, Maine, because they live on an island. (laughter) But our high school was right on the water.  You can put your back right up against the building and throw a rock to the water.  Actually, a lot of freshmen on “Freshman Friday” found it. (laughter) We had the rowing team.  We had the sailing team.  Our teachers were great.  We called them by their first name.  They treated us like adults.  We were one of the few high schools in New Haven that didn't have metal detectors and cameras, and we were trusted to actually walk between five different buildings that were all remodeled oyster shacks – oyster shucking houses.  So, that's just high school. (laughter) 


Once I came up to UMM, it just progressed, other than – I didn't do so great my first year just because I learned so much in high school.  I was so bored.  So completely bored, that I got C's in all my classes.  I didn't even study for exams.  I didn't do my homework.  The only reason why I did well is because I got A's on the exams and did nothing else. (laughter) Not a good recommendation. (laughter)  But it was good.  I learned a lot of stuff.  


Unfortunately, I ended up dropping out my senior year because I was burnt out.  I ended up getting – my first advisor was a math professor.  I scheduled all my core classes and all my easy classes my first two years.  So, by the time I hit my senior year, all I had left was four-credit labs with people like Brian Beal and Gayle Kraus, who have seriously intense senior classes.  I got burnt out, dropped out, ended up getting into the fisheries, and now I'm crazy. (laughter) But I am going back to school, and I did another year, and then I quit my heating job, so I took the semester off because I started up my own heating business, so I couldn't do both at the same time, learning from prior mistakes.  Yeah.  


F1:        [5:24] I want to go back for just a second.  It's such an interesting and unique high school you went to.  Was that your choice?  Your parents’ choice? (inaudible) pick that?


A:        [5:31] My choice.  My choice.  Sound School was there – that got established back in the ’80s.  It was already a very well-established marine school, and they opened it up to more towns.  About 18 towns were allowed to go to this school and all wide ranges.  I mean, some of them were from New Haven, but we had people that were from Ansonia or Guilford.  You didn't only have at that point the racial clash.  We also had the financial clash because you had people that had rich parents, and you had people that didn't even have parents.  So, some were taking the city bus.  Some were getting dropped off by their parents in a BMW.  I mean, it was very unique, but our teachers knew how to handle it.  


One class was a tech class.  We weren't getting along.  It was an hour and a half before school ended.  Our teachers put us in rowboats, dragged us out into the middle of the harbor, mixed us all up, and told us that the busses would be back in an hour and a half and to figure it out. (laughter) We were 14 years old, in boats.  None of us got along, but none of us was going to turn around and call our parents to explain that we missed the bus because we couldn't get along for stupid reasons.  So, guess what? We figured it out.  There was a lot of yelling, couple people fell overboard, but we all made it back and alive.  Then we were all friends after that.


Q:        [7:17] Great.  I want to talk a little bit about your parents.  Where are they from, and what did they do when you were growing up?


A:        [7:23] They're still in Connecticut.  They're in East Haven, Connecticut, with my sister.  My dad is a HVAC heat technician – kind of followed in the footsteps a little bit.  He worked for US Surgical for 20-some-odd years.  He was a maintenance worker, and he used to work on multiple-story size sterilizers for surgical equipment.  My mom worked at a bank for a while, and she was also a bookkeeper.  Right now, she is a bookkeeper for a global company that makes computer chips that were very important during the pandemic.  


Q:        [8:09] What does your sister do?  


A:        [8:11] My sister is an adolescent crisis counselor.  


Q:        [8:14] Do you have any history of fishing in your family, or did you start that? 


A:        [8:19] Being a commercial fisherman?  No.  Being a recreational fisherman?  Yes.  Dad raised us on striped bass, blue fish, tautog.  He used to take us crabbing for blue claw crab.  That's when he learned that he had he was raising a little entrepreneur because we went to Essex Island Marina, and I would scoop up green crabs, and we would sell them a dollar a piece.  I had four little kids working for me.  We were selling these green crabs, and they're like, “Oh, are they legal size?”  Of course, at that time, at that point in time, the legal size was the size of a beer can.  Here I am, eight years old, whipping a beer can out of my back pocket to measure a blue craw crab. (laughter) Yeah.  I just love the water.  I like being on it.  I always find other jobs that take me away, and I always end up back.


Q:        [9:18] Cool.  Yeah, and I'm going to ask this question, I think you sort of answered it, but just for the sake of going through the thing, do you have any history of your family working in other roles in the fishing industry, such as bookkeeping, processing, marketing, bait? 


A:        [9:30] Nope, not directly at all.  Connecticut – you're looking at less than a fraction of a percent that rely on the fish industries.  So, as far as growing up, all my exposure was mostly school, aside from what we did recreationally as a family.  That wasn't until I came up here that I really got into the fisheries.  Actually, originally, when I came up here, I wanted to be a shark researcher.  Nothing close to getting into – but then I learned that instead of going for marine biology, I should have gone for behavioral science and all this other stuff.  Of course, my guidance counselors in high school weren't very useful as far as “This is what I want to do.  What do I need to do to get to that place?”  You would think at a marine biology school that they would have at least a game plan, but no.  


So, I'm like, “Well, we'll figure something else out.”  Then, I had roommates that started rockweed harvesting.  They did it for a while, and I needed a job, and Subway wasn't hacking it.  So, I started rockweeding, and that was actually my first job in the fisheries up here because I tried to get on lobster boats, and I tried to get on other things.  But the problem is, unless you're a sister, a wife, or a daughter, your opportunities aren't there.  When I asked the Acadian Seaplants if they would hire me, their only question was, “Do you know how to run an outboard?”  I'm like, “That I can do.  Dad made sure of that one.”  (laughter) That's how I got into rockweeding.  


Q:        [11:28] Great.  Yeah, I want to come back to that.  Just before we talk a little bit more about that, are you married?


A:        [11:33] Yes, I have a husband.  We've been together for 12 years, married for nine.  I haven't quite figured out how he puts up with me, but he does.  He's actually a sweetheart.  His name is Troy, and he's clamming right now.


Q:        [11:50] Great.  Do you have any children? 


A:        [11:52] No children.  I got fur babies.


Q:        [11:54] So, coming back to rockweed, how would you describe what you do right now?  Then, I would love if you could take me through all of the different things that you've done because I know you've done a lot of different fisheries-related things.


A:        [12:10] What direction are you're trying to go with that? 


F1:        [12:16] Just start from the beginning.


Q:        [12:17] Yeah, just start from the beginning.


A:        [12:18] You want a chronological –?


F1:        [12:19] How old were you (inaudible) rockweed?


A:        [12:20] OK.  Let's see.  It was 2008, so I was 20, 21 when I got into rockweed, and it was literally me and one of my other roommates paired up in a boat in the middle of July in Cobscook.  Never been on a boat in Cobscook in my life, and I was handed a map that was pretty much a cartoon drawing (laughter) with sector numbers and told to have at it.  I mean, they gave a little bit of an educational thing on what the laws were at that point in time, and it was very vague.  


Then, the following summer, it rained a lot.  I didn't harvest.  I ended up working at the Downeast Institute for the summer.  I worked mostly in the algae room.  I was pretty much in charge of growing the major drums of algae and feeding the clams.  [a]And then, when I had time, I helped with other tasks, but that was the algae room.  That was my thing.  


Then, I went back to rockweeding.  It wasn't in Cobscook.  It was actually in Jonesport.  Actually, out of all the sites, Jonesport was probably my favorite.  That was because there was always harvesters.  There was always people around.  Unloading was so much easier because you would park the boats up.  There would be one person running the hoist, one person that swung the boom, one person in the truck, and two people in the boat.  It took five of us to unload, but it wasn't super exhausting because we all had our own task.  It was really nice.  I picked it up.  It swung right over the back of an 18-wheeler.  I always got stuck in the 18-wheeler because I was able to climb the seaweed, run from one side to the other.  I mean, I was 21, 22, 23 years old.  I had energy for days. (laughter) That was great.  I was there for – I don't know – four years.  Got “harvester of the year” a couple times.  


Then I moved to – they moved me to Roque Island, and I became a site manager there.  I fluctuated between two and eight people.  I did a lot of training and teaching people the area.  I got sent to Gouldsboro for a few weeks to train a new crew there.  Then, my last two years, I spent in Cobscook, and that was where I started getting into my late 20s, and I started overlapping with wormweed.  So, I was actually doing two fisheries because I was trying to get myself established in another fishery because it's a very limited market.  I couldn't let go of one until I was set in the other because rockweeding – I still made 20-30 grand in the summer doing rockweeding.  So, unless I was making that much, I couldn't.  Now, I make more than that. (laughter) 


Then I switched to wormweed.  That was about – I think this is my ninth season doing wormweed, so I probably about 27-ish, 28, something like that.  I started up with Gay Crowley on Beals Island and did not know – that’s actually a funny story, how I actually got that job.  She was complaining to her worm buyer down in Connecticut that she was worried about whether or not she was going to be able to get the worms because she could get the worms, but she couldn't get the packing material to ship the worms.  So, the guy is like, “I don't know.”  Well, this bait shop was down the street from the boat club, the boat marina that I grew up at.  I literally grew up in this bait shop, and one of the guys overheard.  He's like, “You know, Bob Butler's daughter does seaweeding, and she's up in Maine.  She might be in that area.”  He got my number from my dad, gave it to the buyer, the buyer gave it to her, and she called me, and she's like, “So, where are you located?”  


At that point in time – no, I didn’t move to Lubec at that point in time.  I was here in Lubec, and she's like, “Well, that's not too far.  I was thinking that you were down somewhere in Portland or something.”  I'm like, “No, I'm Downeast.”  She's like, “Well, come by the shop.  I'll show you what I'm looking for.”  That's how it started.  Her picker wasn't being reliable.  Half the time, they would go for enough to get beer money and then not want to go for the next two, three days.  She's like, “I need somebody reliable.”  I ended up picking up her market, and then eventually, I ended up taking their other market from another buyer.  So, I had two buyers, and then, about last year, I picked up two more buyers.  So, between the four buyers that I do, I pick enough seaweed to employ about 80 to 100 diggers, and between my buyers, they send out, all together, probably close to three-quarters of a million worms a week.


Q:        [18:22] Wow.  


A:        [18:23] (laughter)


Q:        [18:24] So, you started wormweeding.  Have you been doing that consistently since you started?


A:        [18:28] Every summer.  Every summer, I do it.  I get paid anywhere from eight to nine dollars a bag, depending on where I sell it.  Peak of the season, I could be doing anywhere from six to 800 bags a week.  My price only goes up.  It never goes down.  It doesn't fluctuate like other markets.


Q:        [18:52] Wow.  Do you participate in any other fisheries?


A:        [18:55] I do soft shell clamming, wrinkling – I'm getting my halibut tags this year.  I'm working on getting into seaweed kelp aquaculture, and I also harvest probably six or seven other edible seaweeds that I do for small orders here and there.  So, if I can make money and I can get the license, I'll do it.


Q:        [19:29] That's amazing.  I know you were the chair of the clam committee for some time.  Can you talk a little bit about that?


A:        [19:35] Me and that thing has a love-hate relationship.  I love it, but I hate it, and it hates me sometimes.  When I first started doing it, it got plopped in my lap.  They were just looking for committee members at that point in time because we had to have so many members on our clam committee.  I hopped on to it, and then people got off, and people got on, and then somehow I got unanimously voted as chairman at a meeting I wasn't even there for. (laughter) 


Then, I took on that.  It was also because I was really good at filling out the paperwork.  That's what most of it is.  Was filling out paperwork.  If you wanted to do a closure or an opening, you had to submit the form to DMR.  If you wanted to do a seed transplant, you had to submit the permit.  If you wanted to do brushing, you had to get an Army Corps permit, and I was able to always keep it straight, which is the reason why now I'm trying to get rid of it, and I can't seem to. (laughter) 


Licensing time is always a nightmare.  Conservation time is very time-consuming, especially since the diggers are like, “Well, it's in the middle of our tide.”  Well, that's where the clams are.  And they're like, “Well, we don't want to do it.”  And I'm like, “Well, fine, don't.”  We have a tier system.  So, you could either buy out of conservation or you could do the conservation for a discounted rate.  But now, I'm pulling back a little bit.  I am no longer on the committee.  I am no longer the shellfish warden.  I am now just the deputy warden who is supposed to just fill in when the warden goes on vacation. (laughter) But last night, guess what?  I got roped into doing conservation closure paperwork. (laughter)


Q:        [21:50] With all of those different things that you have hands in, can you list all of the fishing licenses that you hold? 


A:        [21:57] It's easier said than done because the seaweed license covers a wide range of everything, but if I did seaweed kelp aquaculture, I would actually have to get a seaweed aquaculture license.  The wrinkle license is under the commercial license, but my halibut is an endorsement underneath that because you just buy the tags, and they tack it onto that license.  Then, you have the shellfish license, and then you have the town shellfish license.  I also do worming sometimes.  So that's about six licenses just fishing.  Those are all the licenses that don't have moratoriums on them, that anybody's allowed to get.  Then, I have my oil license, my propane license, and let's not even get into fishing, hunting, archery – all that stuff.  The state makes quite a bit of money off of me every year. (laughter)


Q:        [23:11] Can I ask, what is the course of your calendar year like?  Can you talk a little –?


A:        [23:19] Usually, April 1st to Labor Day is most of my fishing time.  I'll have a little overlap.  I've had a couple weeks of seaweeding already start, but it’s one order here, two orders there.  It's not really full-blown.  Then, we'll start trickling into it.  Usually, by Memorial Day weekend is when I start really picking up the pace.  By Fourth of July, I’m full bore, and that will stay steady until Labor Day.  Wormweeding really doesn't end until almost Halloween, but it trickles back out.  Most of my fishing stuff is from April to Labor Day, and then from Labor Day to the first of the year, I am usually back at my heating job, and that's usually all boiler and furnace cleanings.  Then, if I'm lucky and I take care of most of the problems, by January to back to April, I'm just doing repairs and installs for heating systems.  So, it's kind of like I have a winter job, I have a summer job, and I'm always doing something different because I'm wicked ADHD, and I get wicked bored. (laughter)


Q:        [24:34] Do you own a boat?


A:        [24:39] I have three skiffs, five canoes, and I am in the process of talking to a guy to build me just the raw hull of something that's about 20 feet long, eight feet wide.  He’s like, “You want a raw hull?”  I'm like, “Yes, I want you to pop it out of the form and deliver it to my dooryard.  That's it.  I don't want paint, I don't want sanding, I don't want gunnels – I don't want nothing.  I want you to pop it out and deliver.”  He's like, “OK, I could do that.” (laughter) I'm going to eventually make that into a boat of some shape because I'm looking for the open hull, and I'm going to put an Aire (sp?) bladder floor in it so I could actually have more buoyancy and be able to carry more weight because that's what I need.  I need to be able to carry weight.  


It's not felt safe because I've rounded – rockweeding – my seaweed boat five and a half ton – come in with a three-inch freeboard, and get pulled over by Coast Guard with marine patrol laughing at me up on the pier because they're trying to measure my free board, because commercially, you’re supposed to have seven inches of freeboard, and I'm shifting my weight to the other side so that I get my seven inches while I'm up – gunnel touching the water on the other side, and Marine Patrol’s laughing.  Coast Guard is none the wiser. (laughter) So, I've built some pretty good relationships with Marine Patrol over the years.  I’m the least of their worries.


Q:        [26:15] Sure.  Can you talk a little bit about experience you have beyond directly fishing and harvesting – I have a list here, this might help you go off – in bookkeeping, bait, or gear preparation?


A:        [26:26] I don't really do bait.  I've worked on a couple lobster boats, but I don't really do much of that.  As far as gear, my gear is usually pretty simple.  I have canoes.  I have to go hunt down a whole bunch of wrinkle sacks, preferably the used ones, so I can put the wormweed in and wash, and I reuse my bags until they fall apart.  But most of my gear is pretty basic.  


I mean, my prized possession is my clam fork.  That's probably the only piece of gear that I'm really picky about, and that's because that's the tool that a lot of people use.  That's all they use, especially when they're clamming.  It has to be comfortable.  It has to be profitable to them.  That is their pride and joy.  It's at the right angle.  The tines are the right length.  There's different kinds of tines, different force with different amounts of tines, where you want your ring.  I mean, it looks so simple until you actually go and dig with it, and it has to be comfortable in your hand.  


Of course, even though I'm right-handed, I dig like a left-handed person, so everything is backward for me, and trying to get my welder to put stuff where I want it to be – because also my hands are smaller, so I got to be able to – I have a hard time holding on to the clam fork.  I actually have my ring hooked to the top of my clam fork so I can hook my thumb actually right in the loop.


Q:        [28:05] Great.  Can you talk a little bit about any experience you might have in processing, marketing, or trade?


A:        [28:18] That's a very open, broad thing.  I really don't deal very much, as far as that goes, for the simple reason – yeah, you harvest it, you bring it to the dealer, to the dealer that has the license to either buy that product.  I also do small orders.  I'll have somebody – “Hey, can you go find me 10 pounds of clams?”  That's the closest I get to actually selling anything.  
 
I looked into trying to find a green crab market, and I had a lot of opportunity, but the problem is transport.  They don't really want to pay for it, or at least not a price that you can profit or even break even on, so it all stalled because unless you can do green crab in a tier product capacity, you can't make any money off of it.  You need your soft shell for your high-end market.  Then you get down into bait, and then you get into specialized fertilizers, and then you get into restaurant stock.  Everybody was like, “Oh, restaurant stock is going to turn around and save it.”  But the problem is if they're only looking to pay 15, 20 cents a pound, I can get more selling it as bait. (laughter)


Q:        [29:48] Yeah.  I think I want to come back to green crabs in a little bit, but just continuing on this, do you have any experience in advocacy or other community-based organization related to fisheries? 


A:        [30:00] Now that I can talk about.  I'm on the Shellfish Advisory Council for the state.  I'm also on Maine Sea Grant’s Policy Advisory Council – committee/council.  I don't remember what their C stands for anymore. (laughter) I am always going to Fishermen's Forum.  I'm always doing stuff like this, talking to people.  I actually had some people down from the southern part of the state that are looking into the odd fisheries, like clamming, like wormweeding, the fisheries that you don't see because everybody sees the lobster boats.  Everybody sees the big boats going out and dragging.  No one turns around and sees the person walking down a path with a bent clam fork and what looks like a vegetable basket. (laughter) 


I've helped with regulation ideas.  Right now, we're working on a subcommittee working on retail for harvesters.  So, say, for instance, I have somebody of the public comes up to me on the beach.  “Hey, can I buy some clams off of you?”  I would actually be legally able to do it because, as of right now, you're not allowed.  I would have to bring my clams here to my house, and they would have to meet me at my house to buy those clams.  


So, we're trying to change it to allow more flexibility.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I break the rules all the time.  I do follow the rules.  This is the one rule I hate.  I have told the people that made this rule that I break it.  So, I'm not afraid to say it.  They already know. (laughter) But legally, I can't sell clams off the back of my truck.  They were talking about this rule and that rule, and there should be some HASSA training and some inspection on your truck.  I'm like, “But you don't go to their house and inspect their house, but that's OK.  But you want to inspect the back of my truck.”  The customer turns around and walks up to my truck and sees gas cans and trash and all kinds of stuff on the back of my truck.  Do you really think they're going to buy those clams from me?  It's the same exact thing as going to the house.  You're just putting more added stipulations to it to make it harder, which I understand because if you open it up, you can risk more illness because there will be people that will mishandle it.  


But at a certain point in time, the more hoops you make them jump through, it ain’t going to change the fact – they're going to do it anyway.  So, you could either work with them, make it legal, make it work for everybody, or they're just going to do it anyway.  Make your choice.  Does the state want to make money, or does the state not want to make money?  Because that's really the only difference at this point in time because Marine Patrol isn't going to enforce it.  They're not going to turn around and tell a clam digger that he can't make an extra dollar a pound for the five pounds that he's going to sell that person off the back of the track.  It's not worth it.


Q:        [33:40] Balancing all these different things that you have hands in, what does an average day look like for you in the season?  What are all the different things you're doing in a day?


A:        [33:52] I am up and out the door by 4:00.  I'm usually passing out on my couch by 7:00 (laughter), and that's if my day is done.  I've had days that I went wormweeding, and I was up at four, picked until it was high tide, and then got all it back to my truck, loaded it out of my canoe, into my truck, brought it down to the ramp, had to wash the bags.  Then I had to drive all the way to Jonesport to make one delivery, Beals Island to another delivery, and then go to the Harrington-Addison-Columbia Falls line, and make another delivery, to then drive all the way back.  I ate, and I went back out on the water.  I had another big order that I had to do, so I picked nearly all the way up to midnight, which was about high water.  I mean, it was like mid-tide, and I was getting exhausted, but I was 45 minutes from home, so I had to make a choice.  OK?  Drive the 45 minutes, try to wind down, get to bed, then drive 45 minutes back in my four-hour window or to sleep in my truck.  


I spend more nights in my truck in the middle of summer than I do at my own house.  Me and my husband, we’ll go four days without seeing each other living in the same house. (laughter) Every day, it's different.  I could be doing it out in the sun.  I can be out there doing it while we're getting three inches of rain.  Wind is usually my biggest barrier, and that's because I do most of it out of a canoe.  But I've also gotten to the point – I'll half-load my boat, and I'll walk it around a long way if I have to.  No matter what, they need the wormweed, and I have to go pick it because I do it primarily by myself.  So, it's me, myself, and the beach. (laughter_


Q:        [36:13] Wow, that is such an insane amount of –


A:        [36:16] Yeah.  So, you're either eating food on the go, or you're packing a lunch, and what foods you do bring with you is important because you need protein and readily available calories and carbs.  When I do fisheries, I have a lunch box.  I have crackers.  I have anything with bread.  My diet during the summer is actually horrible, absolutely horrible.  Chicken and carbs is my whole entire diet during the summer.  Unless I was rockweeding, hot dogs was another big thing, just fat, quick, easy because you can't have anything heavy on your stomach.  I used to drink an ungodly amount of milk because – I couldn't do whole milk because it would sour your stomach in the sun.  But if you did one or 2% it was ready calories right there, quick, easy to burn.  It was enough that you could take a couple swigs and trick your stomach into thinking you weren't hungry to get through the next half hour.  


Because when you're based on the tide, five minutes in this area is a lot because when you're rockweeding – when I pick in a canoe, I'm racing the tide.  I'm picking my seaweed as the tide is going out.  I'm maintaining pushing my canoe out as I'm loading it, and if it gets stuck, I'm stuck until the tide comes back in.  So, turning around and taking a five-minute break is not always an option, and that's why when I was rockweeding, I was always dragging people off of rocks.  Because in this area, a big drainer, our tides can be upwards of 30 feet on a big drainer.  If you break that down into a six-hour tide, you are literally gaining or losing an inch a minute.  Fifteen minutes, you're a foot and a few inches out of the water, which, in a lot of areas, they don't realize that.  


I was talking to this guy in Louisiana.  We were talking about tides.  He’s like, “Do you mean swells?”  I'm like, “No, I'm not talking about swells.  I'm talking high tide, low tide.”  I'm like, “Where you are, you got a three-foot tide.”  If you were down at the Keys, you would have three inches.  They're like, “Nah, it can't be like that.”  I'm like, “Dude, I'm a two-hour boat ride from the biggest tides in the world.”  We are literally second in the US.  We are literally second to only Alaska, and Alaska only got us beat by a couple feet.


Q:        [39:18] Wow.  Yeah.  How do you feel like your background or identity shapes the work you do in the fisheries?


A:        [39:25] I think it makes me more conservative for the simple reason – I went through enough schooling, and I went through – I took marine ecology and all those classes, and so, really, it’s given me a different perspective on what's going on on that beach.  I was talking to somebody that works for the Department of Marine Resources, and the point that I made to her was you are used to reading numbers about a beach.  I am used to going down to the beach and reading the beach.  I turned around to her.  I'm like, “You can spend all these hours doing your bio assessments and all that.  You can give me a clam fork and an hour and a half, and I can tell you more about that beach than the six tides you spent here.”  That's just because I've had so much experience.  I can walk.  I know that hole is different than that hole.  I know that this seaweed is different than that seaweed.  I know this seaweed will grow better on that side of the cove because of the way it faces the sun, and you're not going to find it on the other side of the cove.  So, I ain't going to go there looking for it while you need your data to tell you that it's not on that side of the cove.  


So, it gets me into looking at the different processes, and I like to then figure out how to use those processes to benefit that beach.  For an example, my wormweeding.  I have areas that are very prone to getting sunburnt and rot because the marsh grass only grows about this tall, so it doesn't provide the shade that a three-foot marsh grass blade is going to do.  So, I'll take some of that rotten stuff, I'll package up, I'll bring it to a different beach, and I'll spread it out in grass that's higher, and what survives will then be transplanted there, and I start adding new beaches.  


Also, one great thing about the rot is I'll go wrinkling, and I will take all my coals, all my small snails that I couldn't sell, and I'll go back to those rotted areas, and I'll sprinkle them right on top of it because the rotten seaweed is on a lower edible scale than the actual living plant.  So, the wrinkles will actually target it because it's easier to eat.  So, like rockweed – I can't remember the scale.  It's like a one-to-seven scale.  Rockweed, I think, is a five or a six on that scale.  I'm trying to remember.  I can't remember the name.  Gayle Kraus pounded it into our brain.  But the point I'm getting to is, on the rot version of it, it would only be a two.  


So, it's really easy, high-nutrient, and wrinkles always go for decaying, decomposing stuff and also your fine seaweeds.  That's a biological process that you can actually take and use to benefit the wormweed because what happens is rot is contagious.  So, when it lays and pancakes on top of it, it will actually spread to healthy cells and kill the healthy cells.  So, when you put the wrinkles on the dead rot, they eat all the dead stuff, kind of like leeches trying to fix big wounds.  It will eat all the dead skin so that it can actually – same exact concept, just using two different species.


Q:        [43:06] Do you feel like your – sort of the same question, but do you feel like your gender affects your work in fishing at all?


A:        [43:14] It used to.  Now, not anymore.  Back then, I didn't have a name.  No one really knew me from a hole in the ground.  Oh, there’s Danny.  We know everybody.  What I found was when I was working in Jonesport – it was definitely more prominent – was I was the only girl on the crew for the first few years.  When you came in with a rounded boat and a ponytail flapping in the wind, people start taking notice.  Then, you go into the gas station and grab my hot dog and whatever.  Actually, at that point in time, I drank a lot of vitamin water.  Should have had a scholarship or a subscription or something, but that's how they got to know me.  


And then I became the seaweed girl, and then I got into wormweeding.  It got to the point that if I wanted to, on any given day, I could pack my lunch and my rain gear and go down to Jonesport, stand on the wharf, and end up on the back of the boat like that.  I would have never been able to do it back then.  I tried it.  Didn't work.  Because all they saw was this little five-foot-six.  At that point in time, I was 110 pounds.  I weighed absolutely nothing.  So, getting on a boat, as I said, if you weren't the wife, the daughter, or a sister of a fisherman, the odds of you getting on a boat was really slim to none unless you turn around and got the licenses and you got your own boat, which I did about eight times over. (laughter)


Q:        [45:05] Do you feel like fishing works with any family or caregiving responsibilities you might have?


A:        [45:14] Not really.  I mean, other than paying the bills.  I guess either A, I don't understand the question, or B, literally just pay the bills, is the answer.


Q:        [45:26] Sure.  So, we’re going to transition now into environmental change.  Can you describe any changes in the marine environment that you've noticed while you've been working on the water?


A:        [45:37] Temperature.  Storms have been a little bit crazier.  I think the biggest thing I've noticed – I'm not sure if anybody else noticed, or I'm just crazy –it almost feels like all the seasons shifted a month, and it's been like that for like four or five years.  Our falls are going later into the year.  Our springs are taking a little bit longer to come on.  Then, here we are in Maine.  For the longest time, we would be like 65, 70, 75 degrees for most of the summer.  We hit 80 for like two weeks in August.  Now, we've been like 80, 90 degrees for most of the summer, which is extremely abnormal.  I don't know.  Something screwy is happening, but I'm also the type of person – can it be global warming?  Yes, but everything also has a cycle too.  So, we could be overlapping multiple things.  


One thing I can say is with seas rising – I'm noticing it more with the salt marsh grass – I'm slowly losing my lower part of the marsh grass.  Some of it is to erosion.  Some of it is just the stalks aren't coming back up.  Some areas, I know it's green crabs because you can go to an area, and they all have the same cut right on the top – nice, straight, smooth.  It’s not like it's jagged.  It looks like somebody went in with a pair of scissors.  That’s green crabs.  If you got green crabs eating marsh grass, there are no clams there.  There are no shrimp there.  There are no other thing that they're eating that they have to resort to marsh grass that are in the top two hours of the tide.  


So, it's a lot of different things.  Green crabs love our weather.  We haven't had enough harsh winters to really keep the numbers down, and it's going to get to a point – I'm a little curious to see how this summer is going to be because we didn't have –  this is probably the mildest winter we've had in at least my 18 years of being up here.


Q:        [48:16] Yeah.  How are these changes you're seeing impacting what you do?


A:        [48:21] It's killing me with wormweeding because I work in a very narrow strip.  When I'm wormweeding, I need to have marsh grass.  I need to have a rockweed source, and I need to have a freshwater source.  If I don't have those three, odds of me finding it slim to none.  Then you compound that with some areas, the banks are just straight up eroding away and dropping off and taking chunks of marsh grass right with it.  Then, you have the green slime has been really bad the last couple of years, and that's because we’ve been having such rainy springs.  It’s dumping so much nutrients while we have the cold water that the green slime is taking hold very quick.  It creates a mat that can be upwards of a quarter to a half-inch thick.  It just smothers everything underneath it.  


So, when you have your little stalks of marsh grass trying to re-emerge come spring, it hits that barrier, and they die.  You can pull that off and see all the grass that's just curled over because they couldn't make it up through.  When I get into areas that I know that that's bad, I'll take my fingers, and I'll run it through the marsh grass and try to break it apart a little bit.  Unless there's marsh grass, I don't have a job because it doesn't collect it.  


To explain why that is, is wormweed is ascophyllum nodosum.  It actually is rockweed.  What happens is little fragments break off and get caught up in the marsh grass.  It never puts down a hold fast.  So, if you were to compare it to the Ross versus Acadian Seaplant lawsuit – that lawsuit forced DMR to distinguish between the two, so it made wormweed have a really gray zone, but it's detached.  What happens is, when it's detached, gets caught up in the marsh grass, it starts growing into a mat rather than the typical growing up like a tree.  After about three years, if it's not picked or thinned out, it will actually convert back to rockweed and then get pulled out and float somewhere else.  So, that's how wormweed grows. (laughter)


Q:        [51:03] Sure.  Is there anything that you've tried to kind of adapt to the changes that you're seeing?


A:        [51:10] Other than transplant to new beaches, it’s kind of – I do a lot of rotation.  I have some beaches that I can harvest two, three times a year.  I have some beaches I can only harvest every other year or every third year.  Every beach is different.  So, when I go, and I approach a beach, I will walk it first before I dive into just picking it because I make the decision – OK.  If it's this long, which – that's about – what – inch and a half, two inches.  If I wait a month and a half, it will be four inches long, and I can actually harvest twice the amount.  


It's not as much an adaptation as it is treating it like farming.  Is this ready to harvest?  Would I be better off leaving it?  Am I going to be able to make it back here at a certain point in time?  Do I know that there's a big storm that might be coming, but the dead marsh grass is gone, and this new stuff isn't tall enough to leave it there?  Maybe I should pick it now, or a storm is just going to pile it up at the high tide mark, where it's going to rot.  Every beach, you just got to handle it as the beach.  Yeah, more like farming.  More like aquaculture without a permit. (laughter)


Q:        [52:38] How do you feel like – what allows you to know that so well?  How have you come to those understandings?


A:        [52:48] School helped a lot.  School definitely helped a lot, especially when it got into reading scientific papers because it takes finesse.  You don't turn around and pick up your first scientific paper, read it, and understand it.  I remember my first paper was the easiest, stupidest one that you could possibly read, and I had to read it four times before I figured out what they were trying to talk about.  Because it's like, yeah, I could read it, but did I understand it?  Did I actually get out of it what they got out of it?  


I have a filing cabinet in there of all kinds of scientific papers – different fisheries – and just looking at relationships between things.  After a very long time staring at beaches, it kind of becomes second nature because – when I was applying for a job, I had to go figure – it was in the marine sciences, so I was trying to figure out my resume and what fisheries I was doing.  I had to go through my tax returns to figure out it all.  I kind of had to go and explain that – wait, I just lost my train of thought.  Where was I going?


Q:        [54:14] You were talking about your background making it possible to understand the ways that –


A:        [54:22] Yeah, but there was a very specific route I was going.


Q:        [54:25] Scientific papers, thinking about applying to work at DEI, I think.  


A:        [54:29] Nope, it was DMR. 


Q:        [54:30] DMR.


F2:        [54:32] Filing cabinet. (inaudible).


A:        [52:34] You guys want a bottle of water to take? 


F2:        [54:37] Yeah.


A:        [54:38] Yeah.  I'll go grab water.  Give me a second.  I'm sure it'll pop in my head.


Q:        [54:42] So, what has made it possible for you to, in your specific case, understand how to interact with beaches?  For example, are there any resources, relationships, trainings, or organizations that you drew on to be able to assess and –?


A:        [54:59] Oh, no, I made it up all as I went along.  That's what most of us fishermen do, is we just literally make it up as we go along.  I mean, education really helped, but – I may remember my point.  I was figuring out all my jobs and all my fisheries, and for shits and giggles, me and my husband started figuring out how many hours I have worked on the beach.  OK?  We gave up counting at 27,000 hours. (laughter) That was the point I was trying to get to.  After tens of thousands of hours, at a certain point in time, I could tell you more about certain species than probably most people can.  They might have their fancy little experiment that they ran for a few months or six months or maybe a year, but I have stared at the same exact plant for eight, nine years, and compile that with education and scientific papers.  It allows me to pool from different things, even sometimes minute detail that might be relevant, that somebody else would get lost because they needed a scientific paper to tell them that it exists.  


When I was rockweed harvesting, when I was training, I had a very specific rule.  I did what we call the half rule.  Legally, you have to leave 16 inches.  Well, no one is going, measuring 16 inches and cutting it above the 16-inch mark.  It's kind of hard to just – it was a horribly designed rule for the simple reason it’s damn near impossible to actually do it.  But the half rule made it easier.  If I knew I was in four feet of water, I dropped my rake right below the water surface, and I started pulling in, I knew I was cutting at three feet.  If I was up at the high tide mark, the whole entire plant was submerged.  I would take half the plant.  If it was an eight-foot plant, I would leave four feet of it.  This way, I never got anywhere near the 16-inch rule.  


The following year, I was able to go back and harvest the same area because I left plant behind do it.  Now, the way ascophyllum is grown – it's kind of like a cone shape.  The further down you cut, you're only gaining ounces when you're being paid by the ton.  So, where are you going to target? You're going to target the top of the cone, or at least that's where you should be targeting is the top of the cone.  That is the issue that we've had with a lot of activism, is that you get a whole bunch of people in there that are new.  They don't know anything.  They don't have a couple years under the belt that tells them, “Hey, I should be harvesting up higher on the plant for the pounds rather than the ounces.”  It just completely works into their narrative, and it got to the point that they started driving out the harvesters that actually knew what they were doing and created this high overturn of rookies that literally just fed the activism even further.  


It was actually the activism that is fucking up the activism (laughter), which is kind of hard to explain to people because I had – like, with the lawsuit, now the landowner decides whether or not they can harvest.  You want to know what it costs?  It's causing over-harvesting in other areas because they can't spread out their harvest.  So, the activists have literally caused the problem, but we're the innocent ones trying to save the environment.  


To be completely honest, being on the beach would show you the difference, not the scientific paper about a bird that, as of right now, is only spreading parasites to other fisheries, especially because it builds up – this parasite that this bird – if you actually really pay attention to the Rockweed Coalition, and the bird she's specifically talking about that she wants to protect – in its poop, there’s a parasite that floats around in the water and gets caught on the green crab grill gills.  So, as they start eating the green crabs, the amount of parasites increase.  If you go to turn around and use green crabs as bait for lobster, you could give lobster zombie disease, which is this exact parasite that's coming from this bird.  Ain't that screwed up?  


When you start really getting into the papers and trying to actually follow the chain of everything, it's amazing how you can make an argument for something so small that’s so devastating to other things.  Seaweed is the only thing her and I can't talk about. (laughter) You'll know exactly – if you looked them up, you'll know exactly who I'm talking about.  Unfortunately, if you met her 15 years ago, she was actually a real fantastic person.  She was actually a scientist I would have trusted, especially when it comes to rockweed, one very controversial industry in Maine is that this fishery has literally turned activism into a mental health illness, which is pretty scary that the human population could be that vulnerable.  


Q:        [1:01:25] Can you talk a little bit more about what you mean by that?


A:        [1:01:29] This woman I am talking – I'm not going to name her because I'm not – but this woman has gone from being an activist to downright stalking harvesters.  Last year, she called Marine Patrol on me seven times.  I didn't get a summons out of any of those seven times.  She even tried to call Coast Guard because I didn't have seven inches of freeboard in my canoe. (laughter) She even put an article in the Quoddy Tides about a month ago, talking about how it's the environment and this and that, and then she had a clam chairman talk about how rockweeding is harmful to clamming.  Here's the thing.  I know that chairman.  I know him very well, dealt with them many times, and seaweed is also another thing him and I can't talk about.  But his town has five clam diggers, and they haven't harvested a single clam in 10 years.  So, I'm trying to figure out how the hell does he know that rockweed harvesting is bad if he has not had any rockweed harvested in this town and has no clams.  I am taught – things like that – that is a biased remark.  Biased is what gets scientists in trouble, which is why I can't talk about that. (laughter) 


Q:        [1:03:19] I’ll change the subject.  I'm curious if there are any – as you sort of look towards the future, you've mentioned the possibility of aquaculture.  I'm curious what moves or changes, or if there's anything you want to do as you look towards your future of involvement with fisheries.


A:        [1:03:38] I want to get into seaweed aquaculture because, the fact of the matter is, once the vertebrates and the invertebrates can't handle our increasing water temperatures and stuff like that, the seaweed is what's going to be left.  So, instead of going multiple avenues just to end up at that point anyway, might as well – because, honestly, 25 years now, your aquaculture is going to be seaweed and fish.  That's what it's going to be.  


Oysters are going to be certain point because they're seeing it down south.  I mean, yes, we have vibrio.  Vibrio isn't going to be what kills the oysters.  Maine hasn't seen dermo or MSX or the other parasites that actually wipe out oyster, especially the American oyster.  That's why they're doing more of the European oysters, for the simple reason, they're more resistant to those different kind of parasites and also can handle the colder waters.  


Eventually, their range is going to shift, too.  Eventually, it's either going to shift out, or it's going to die.  I just don't think it's something that's going to be really there for the long term.  So, kelp is where I'm going to put my money, especially since it's a multi-billion-dollar worldwide industry.  There's never a surplus.  There's always more demand and more demand.  So why not get a piece of the pie?


Q:        [1:05:23] Sure.  As you look towards the future, what is your biggest concern about the marine environment for Maine's fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [1:05:35] Whether or not we can adapt fast enough.  Because the fact of the matter is we're not going to be able to create enough change to actually stop this.  We can go with all the wind turbines and all the solar panels and all the electric cars that you can possibly imagine – if we can flip a switch and turn around and get rid of the need for all petroleum base in a single instant, we are still not going to fix it.  We're already there.  So, at this point in time, it's either you deal or adapt, and where you fall in that line is whether or not you're going to survive.  


Q:        [1:06:20] What do you think those adaptations will look like?  You mentioned kelp aquacultures.  Do you have any more thoughts?


A:        [1:06:27] Actually, I think kelp aquaculture is probably going to be the closest way to even solving a problem for the simple reason – kelp can actually absorb more carbon than nearly any species on the planet.  If we were to flip that switch and get rid of all our carbon producers, we would need kelp just to take the edge off.  So, seaweed is still where I'm putting my money.


Q:        [1:06:58] If you could tell policymakers what their biggest priority should be to help people adapt or as they look forward, what would you tell them?


A:        [1:07:07] Stop killing the fucking whales. (laughter) No.  They're all trying.  But the problem is we need to stop listening to the people with the money, and the ones with the money sometimes are wolves in sheep's clothing.  There are plenty of organizations that tried to kill our lobster industry.  Doesn't necessarily mean that their policies were correct, but they obviously had money to do something and create a problem.  It’s not as much as what I would tell the policymakers and stuff.  It would be more about telling the people that vote them in.  


Q:        [1:08:06] What would you tell those people, if you don't mind me asking? 


A:        [1:08:11] Just to be cautious.  I mean, there are people that – I don't know how to explain it the best way without getting myself in trouble. (laughter)


Q:        [1:08:24] We can also move on if you’d rather.


A:        [1:08:27] It's more along the lines of take things more of a grain of salt because you're going to have – “Oh, you should be listening to the science.”  “Oh, the science isn't reliable.”  “Oh, we should be listening to the people with money because they're the ones that made the money, so obviously they had to do something right,” which does not necessarily mean that it is right.  If it makes you scratch your head and wonder, then it's probably not a good idea.  


Look at the last two presidential elections.  We've had three candidates, and as far as I'm concerned, all three of them made me scratch my head.  We have 321 million people, and Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Biden was the best we could come up with.  There's a reason for it.  The problem is, you just think you're voting for somebody into an office when reality is it is the couple thousand people that are behind them that you're actually voting into that office.  They're just puppets.  They're just a face.  One was supposed to – “Yes, let's reduce taxes.  Let's make everything better.”  One, “Let's fold on just about everything.”  And another one, “Oh, I'm a woman.”  But I can't say anything.  I voted for Trump (laughter) both times. 


Q:        [1:10:05] Transitioning into resilience as you look towards the future, I'm curious, have you ever participated in any kind of resilience or training program, maybe related to climate or just like any other kind of adaptation? 


A:        [1:10:18] I'm working on some stuff now, but it's such beginning stages, I can't really talk about it because we got – one group I'm working with got funding from NOAA to work on resilience and set up a working waterfront climate plan, but it's so beginning stages that we haven't even started interviews yet.  We're literally still coming up with the questions.  But the problem is – like, at a clam meeting last night, I am trying to work on a project to build an access up Federal Harbor.  Well, the cement pier, which is a commercial pier down in Lubec, over the last few storms, took a bunch of damage.  Well, guess what? They want to put a squash on my access project up here because they want the money to do the commercial pier.  But the way that I found the money to do that is because it has to also be accessed to recreational, so they can't use my money.  


Now they want to squash that, to shift priority to that.  But fact of the matter is, the town has taken no responsibility in preparing to ever have to fix that thing since it was installed 50, 60 years ago.  As far as I'm concerned, their ill-planning is not my problem.  Their ill-planning should not be on the taxpayers now because they ill-planned.  


We know that weather is getting way worse.  We know that storms are becoming more intense and more frequent, and you want to wait until it's actually damaged to have done something about it when fact on the matter is you knew about the problems three years ago.  Why weren't you working on it three years ago?  Why weren't you turning around and deciding to take $10,000 out of the general fund and put it in a kitty and save up the money until you had chance to actually replace it?  No, they didn't want to do that, and now they're in the tough position that they're trying to figure out a way of fixing it without it being a cost to the taxpayers.  But where they close it down for recreational use, they took their funding pool from being this big, a big ocean to a puddle, and now they're mad because I used avenues to get access for commercial harvesters by also allowing access for recreational harvesting or other activities because the clam diggers are going to be out there at low tide, the recreational users are going to be up there at high tide, so they're not even going to conflict.  But I'm using recreation to get the money to support the commercial.
                
Q:        [1:13:45] Yeah.  Speaking of being really smart about other avenues or looking towards that, what other strategies do you think would be really effective, looking towards the future, for promoting resilience?


A:        [1:13:57] Giving an incentive.  Half of my clam diggers don't even have boats, so they either have to get on a boat with somebody or they have to get permission by some gracious landowner.  Now, the Municipal Association are working on putting a bill in to allow a tax credit for walking paths for commercial harvesting.  So, there are things in the works right now, and finding unique ways – we had a property that – the town owned one path, but we needed a path right across the high tide mark because it was steep and not safe right there.  If we were able to go across even just 100 feet, there was a smoother way down.  What we ended up doing was talking to the property owner.  They ended up donating that walking path right at the high tide mark and exchanged – their tax property moved from being waterfront to water view, giving them almost a $1,800 tax break on their property.  That's a big deal to somebody, especially if it's a lot of elderly in this area who really can't afford their taxes, which I think it's retarded that they even pay taxes after 65, but that's another story.  


There's plenty of creative ways to come up with getting everybody to get along.  That's what you need to do.  Everybody has to get along.  But the problem is, the getting along usually gets divided once money becomes a conversation.  There's a house that right now is up for sale in South Lubec, and us clam diggers were talking about whether or not we would still have access after it sold.  I turned around to him, like, I highly doubt we'll have access, especially since that's a $1.2 million house.  They're not going to give us permission to walk across their property to go to work.  When the original guy bought it, he bought it for literally $350,000.  He gave us permission to walk across that property.  It turns around and goes up four times in price.  It's not going to happen.


Q:        [1:16:50] To the point of shore access, are there any other changes that are maybe not environmental that you're seeing that are impacting your work?


A:        [1:16:57] The fluctuation of people moving in.  Honestly that right now is one of our biggest problems.  During the pandemic – and it's slowed down since, but there was a two-year span that over 100 houses changed hands.  Now, a lot of people won't think 100 houses is a lot, but when there's only 1200 houses in the town – that's one in 12 changed hands in two years.  That is a pretty massive percentage.  Some of them have been great.  Some of them have not been very great.  Some of them have heard stories from their neighbors that were horror stories about people that they've had to deal with from 10, 15 years ago.  The stories never die.  And then, on top of it, some of those stories are so irrelevant to the point that the person that actually did them is not even alive anymore.  So, it becomes this vicious cycle.  


All you can do is try to get as much information out, educate people, and talk to people.  We do clambakes.  We did a clambake last year, our first one, and we were taught – gave us a chance for landowners and harvesters to talk.  We worked on – instead of putting up “No Trespassing” signs, put up “No Trespassing without Permission” signs because that then tells the harvester, “OK, I got to go talk to this person if I want permission.”  Half of the time, they won't turn around and say, “No.”  They just want to know who's on their property.  They want to know how you're going to treat their property.  They want to know, are you going to be out there at 2:00 in the morning or at 10:00 at night, or you’re going to be there during the day.  I have a few landowners that have conditions, and if you're willing to do the conditions, then you get to keep your access.  


But the problem is – I'm worried about a place like Lubec turning into a place like Wells, where for the last 10 years, they've been fighting over who owns the intertidal when the fact of the matter is, the state just has to fucking grow a set and say, “We own the intertidal.” (laughter) Like with me with sea weeding, I spent a lot of time looking at deeds, because technically, only the colonial deeds are the ones that own to the low tide mark.  Well, if you go back and look at some of these places – some of them, the low tide mark got magically added in the ’80s.  Now, you're actually looking at – is their deed actually valid?  So, if I turn around and harvest an area that Marine Patrol says it's in the deed, I can't do it.  I'm going to go back 100 years.  I'm going to go back to as far as I can find it, and then I'm going challenge the validity of their deed because – make them prove that their deed is valid because if they can't prove their deed is valid, I can't be charged with anything and (inaudible) not only be dropped but completely stricken from my record.  


Deeds are a real messed up thing in Maine because some of them – they just bought the house, and literally, when they wrote the deed, just magically added it.  There's no reason – I couldn't find any law that gave them the right to even add it to their deed.  There's places that the towns are not even taxing them for their intertidal space, and yet they think they have a claim to it.  Then, pay the taxes.  You want to have a claim to it, pay the taxes.  You don't want to have – you don't want to see somebody else taking a stroll on your beach, pay the goddamn taxes.  But access is a very touchy, touchy subject.


Q:        [1:21:51] Do you think that the clam bakes and education and talking to landowners, do you think that's helping? 


A:        [1:21:57] It is helping.  Right now, we are in a dispute with Coffins Neck.  They formulated a road owners’ association.  Yeah, you're allowed to do that in Maine.  It's kind of like an HOA version for a road.  They're trying to keep out all commercial fisheries and stuff like that.  It's really boiling over at this point because they're having people arrested.  The people that are getting arrested are instead putting stuff in the roads, popped tires – right now, it's a full-blown out war.  The thing is, they started it because their bylaws are actually messed up.  You have to have 20% of the agreement of the 73 properties, or you have to have 60% of the agreement of the board.  Well, there's only five people on the board, so you only have to have three out of the five.  That's when they turn around and submit the change to keep commercial fishermen out of there – they use the three people on the board to do it.  


A lot of the people didn't get the emails to actually vote within the certain amount of time–  the people that actually live there – so it got back-doored in.  Right now, even their own people are fighting amongst each other because – there's one person up there.  He's like, “I live all the way to the end of the road.”  He's the last house on that road.  He's like, “As far as I'm concerned, you all have permission.  You want it in writing?  You come see me.”  So he just turned around and over ranked everybody by giving permission to the whole entire fucking road, to the whole entire town.  So, it's been a battle right now.  The thing is, this could have been talked out and solved six months ago.


Q:        [1:24:17] I'm curious, have you seen any real positive change, not just related to this, but just in everything you do?  Are there any things you've seen that have been really positive or opportunities (inaudible)?


A:        [1:24:27] Honestly, since we started putting more stuff on Facebook and being more transparent about what we're doing as shellfish harvesters, it really helped.  I'm always posting the rain closures and our explaining why we do conservation closures, why we're doing conservation days, and why are we turning around and doing this clam bake and this and that.  We get actually a lot of good support from the town.  The town is really good at being supportive, especially you are throwing an event because there's nothing else to do other than hang out and drink. (laughter) 


That's why with this group that I was talking about doing the resilience and wanting to do surveys and talk to people, they're like, “When's the best time?”  I’m like, “The best time is for us to set up a clam bake, bring your own beer, and you just wander around and talk to people.”  Because it is a whole lot easier to turn around and answer questions about the environment with a beer in your hand. (laughter) There might be a whole lot more willing to be like, “Hey, they seem chill.  Let's have a little bit more of a conversation rather than thinking somebody who's coming in asking questions in a lab coat or something, which is what they picture in their head.  They have this image of a scientist, and if it's easier to break down that image, it's actually easier to get more answers and actually work with one another.  We do a lot of discussing over beer, usually at the only bar in town. (laughter)


Q:        [1:26:10] As you're looking towards this future, what is your hopeful vision for what fisheries could be for Maine?


A:        [1:26:17] That they'll still be there when the next generation gets there, and that is concerning because the way I see it is if we, the fishery, don't ruin it, the lawmakers will ruin it, or the activists will ruin it.  Let's not even get into the groups that just buy up land.


Q:        [1:26:48] So, I asked what is your hopeful vision.  Do you think that that's the realistic vision?


A:        [1:27:01] No, I think we're just going to keep diluting it for every generation coming after because that's the human way.


Q:        [1:27:14] In your time, I think you've already mentioned this, but I'm curious – you mentioned a real difference in perception from when you started to now.  Have you seen that on the whole for women in the fishery?  Have you seen more women get involved?  What is your perception of that? 


A:        [1:27:27] Honestly, women getting involved is so much easier now than it was for me 15, 16 years ago.  Actually, what I'm finding now that it's easier for women to get into the fisheries – it was actually easier for me to get into the fisheries than it was for me to become a heat technician.  The dynamic, the perception, is very different.  They look at a female fisherman now, and they're like, “Yeah.”  A female heat technician – they're very skeptical because we hear about women in the fisheries.  We don't hear about a lot of women in the trades, especially in Maine.  I am the only master oil burner technician in Washington County that's a female.  I'm the only one with my propane licenses that is female.  Actually, you have to go past Bangor in order to find a woman that does heat.  There's only six of us in the state. (laughter) So, number even smaller than the amount of women in the fisheries.  


I did one cleaning for a guy, and he was an old guy.  Of course, he was deaf, so when he was on the phone, he had to have it on speakerphone.  I'm working on his furnace, and he goes upstairs, and he calls up my boss – turns around to my boss, is like, “Eric (sp?), you know how I'm supposed to have a cleaning on my furnace today?”  And Eric's like, “Yeah.”  “Do you know you sent me a woman?” (laughter) Of course, my boss is laughing on the other end.  “Dude, she's good.  She's been doing this for years.  She does so many cleanings.  She's better at it than I am at this point.  She will be fine.”  “But she's a woman.”  I'm like, “Last time I checked, even though I don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure she does.” (laughter) Because when I got hired, he's like, “I am foolish to not hire a woman.  But I'm going to tell you one piece of advice.  Don't take shit from anybody,” which is why him and I – we had this love-hate relationship.  He's fired me four times and hired me back in the same day. (laughter) He's like, “You know, you're lucky you're a woman.”  I'm like, “No.  Me, being a woman just limits your options.” (laughter)


Q:        [1:30:13] You do feel that there are opportunities for women (inaudible)?


A:        [1:30:16] There's opportunities, but you got to have the mindset of – you can't change everybody's opinion.  You're going to have some that are just – that's just the way they are.  It’s not just from men, either.  I had a woman.  I did her cleaning.  She called up the shop.  “Amanda did a fantastic job.  But next time, can you send me a man?  I really don't think women should be doing this kind of work.”  You can't change that.  She knows I did a good job.  She told my boss that I did a good job, but I wasn't going to change her mind.  And it's one of those – you win some battles, you lose some battles, and you got to play the long game.  You can't turn around and take it personally.  You got to just move on to the next one.  Because with heat, I deal with over 1000 customers in the course of a season.  I only have problems with maybe five or six of them.  So, I'm not going to harp on those five or six.  I'm going to move on and do my thing.  They like me.  They hate me.  I don't give two flying fucks.  Sorry.  I'm probably not supposed to swear.  


Q:        [1:31:33] No, it's totally OK.


A:        [1:31:37] Just make sure you give them a warning label. (laughter)


Q:        [1:31:40] (laughter) We’re reaching the end of the interview, but before we start closing, I'm curious if there's anything else you want to mention that we haven't brought up in the process.


A:        [1:31:49] No, I think we covered a lot, and I know I tangent a whole bunch of times.


Q:        [1:31:52] No, it's been so great.  I'm curious.  Jess and Hillary, do you have any questions? 


F1:        [1:31:56] Yeah, I wanted to ask you – you talked about the impact of green crabs on the salt marshes, which impacts your seaweed harvest, which is really interesting.  I hadn't heard that.  I'm more familiar with the impacts of green crabs on clams –


A:        [1:32:08] Yeah, because that's all that gets –


F1:        [1:32:09] – and shellfish.  Yeah.  So, I just wanted to ask if you wanted to say anything about that as a clammer or just anything else about their impacts on your various fisheries activities.


A:        [1:32:19] Green crabs impact everything.  The problem is green crabs is not a “us” problem or “them” problem.  It affects us all.  It affects the lobster fishermen.  It affects all the groundfish.  It affects scalloping and clamming and seaweed and marsh – they'll eat anything.  They are literally the pigs of the ocean.  The problem is we've always tackled it as a “us” and “them” problem rather than all of us.


F1:        [1:33:00] Meaning divisions among the fisheries in terms of – 


A:        [1:33:03] Yes.


F1:        [1:33:04] Yeah. (inaudible)


A:        [1:33:05] Because they only want to take care of their problem, but they're not solving the problem.  They're fixing a little blurp of their area.  We were talking about green crab trapping last night, and I turned around to him, and I'm like – because they want to work on West Lubec.  But the problem is, unless we get (inaudible) or whiting on board, we're just going to get their green crabs, and we can't fish enough to get their green crabs and our green crabs.  So, until they get off their asses, we're never going to solve the problem.  


It's not even just in the fishery.  It's division among towns and communities.  Green crab is a “all of us” problem, and if we want to solve green crabs, it's going to take all of us to do it.  There's a bunch of different studies that are coming out on trying to tackle and reduce population.  But the problem is all the ones that are having success is because they're using cannibalism to solve the problem because all their clams and all their beds that they're trying to protect are already gone, so there's no food source for the green crabs.  Then, the green crabs are choosing to eat themselves.  


There's right now an experiment going on the West Coast.  They are trapping them and are only taking the females and releasing the males back because the females control the population.  What they're finding is when there's no food source for the green crabs, these bigger, larger male ones will eat the smaller ones that are also eating the smaller females that aren't getting trapped.  They're literally reducing their own numbers on their own.  But the problem – what they're finding is now their populations are coming back, and if they slow down their initiative, they're going to be back to square one because what they found when they were taking them – both genders – was that they were just reducing the stress on the food source so they weren't tapping into the cannibalism, and then the populations were just skyrocketing.  


F1:        [1:35:44] I’ve seen the science on that.  It’s fascinating.


A:        [1:35:45] Yeah. 


F1:        [1:35:46] It’s sad.  All this effort led to actual population booms.


A:        [1:35:49] Yes.  But the thing is, that also made – they've changed their design about three, four different times already, which is – that's how science should work. 


F1:        [1:36:01] It's really interesting and cool your perspective of both somebody who reads the science and who feels the effects and sees it and was working on the ground.  I'm interested.  You talked about – for a little while, you were targeting green crab as a fishery and mentioned soft shell and selling for bait and fertilizer and different stuff.  I'm just curious.  When was that, that you were doing that, and what made you get into that?


A:        [1:36:25] It's been one of those things that keeps on coming back up. (laughter) I really started, really heavily looking into trying to do something about it about three years ago.  So it wasn't really all that long ago.  I talked about – I used to do recreational fishing.  Well, green crabs is used as bait for tautogs down in Connecticut. But the season is very short, and they don't really want to pay a whole hell of a lot.  That started with that.  But they want to pay  $15 for a 50-pound bag, and you have to, bare minimum, get it to the Maine-New Hampshire border, if not down to Boston to the actual market.  So, unless you have a couple 100 bags, you're breaking even, barely breaking even.  


F1:        [1:37:28] You said transportation was (inaudible) –


A:        [1:37:31] Transportation is the most – is the worst thing.  Then, I started looking at either getting more for the green crabs or finding more local markets.  Getting more for the green crabs – over in Italy, they'll actually pay $26 a pound for soft-shell green crabs, and all they do is fry them up and sell them like chicken nuggets with dipping sauce.  $26 a pound.  That's crazy.  But the problem is, as soon as they molt, you have to have them straight on ice.  You got to get them to the market.  You have to get them over to Europe.  Even the Asian market has a strong green crab market.  The problem is, they're very messy to move, messy to deal with.  You got to have constant ice on them all the time, or you would have to probably either go the route of dry freezing or some other preservative process to be able to get them over to Italy within a reasonable amount of time frame.  So it gets very, very complicated because I even looked into – with the Asian market, urchin is a very strong agent market and also is wrinkling.  


So, was there a way that we can harvest green crabs and somehow piggyback off of those transporting methods because they already have to get there anyway?  But I didn't find really any interest.  Then I started switching to local, of which I was doing more of the specialized compost, of which I'm sure you might have heard of Maine Coast Fertilizers.  They produce, right over in Marion, which is like 20 minutes from us, is one of their packaging plant.  I was trying to talk to them, but they only want to pay seven dollars a yard for green crabs, and we would have to pay for half the cost of the dumpster.  They would come and do all the transport costs.  But you turn around and fill a 30-yard dumpster – you want to know how much you make off of it after everything is paid?  $15.  That doesn't even cover bait.  That's just covering me putting them in that container, and them coming and getting it.


F1:        [1:40:11] Were you ever able to get or find local market for the soft-shell crab where there's not enough –?  That connection wasn’t made.


A:        [1:40:18] It's also so short-term.  The biggest issue is that we have tourism for a couple months out of the year.  Then those places either shut down or stay open to locals, and locals are not going to eat green crabs. (laughter) They'll eat their halibut.  They’ll eat their lobster.  But the thing is, they have seen 20 million green crabs pile onto a dead fish or whatever, and they aren't eating that.  Just like most locals don't eat wrinkles either.  They know what it is.  They're not interested.  I had one restaurant, but she only wanted a couple pounds a week because – and I wasn't going to turn around and charge her $26 a pound for a couple pounds.  The problem is, they're so hard to, one, find when they're soft shell or you have to harvest them before they start turning soft shell and maintain them until they actually do molt.  And then you have a very limited amount of time of getting – they're a huge pain in the ass to do soft shell.  It's not like green crab, where there's established processes.  They could even be tricked with temperature to force molting.


F1:        [1:41:50] Which crab is that (inaudible)?


A:        [1:41:52] The blue claw crab.  There's just not enough – we know a lot, but we don't know enough about green crab.  I eventually want – I'm right now working on a project on my own to try to figure out a way to use green crab biomass assessments to make decisions on the adjacent clam flats.  For instance, if you know that you have a green crab, that they range from this size to this size, but we know that this size green crab can't eat anything bigger than this size clam, then maybe when we do our seeding and our transplants, the clams that we should be putting on that beach is bigger than the clams that could be eaten by those green crabs.  I'm kind of like working on –


F1:        [1:42:47] Through your role on the committee and your –


A:        [1:42:49] No, I'm doing this completely on my own for shits and giggles.  Actually, what I was trying to do – the state has a program that does biomass assessments for the actual beaches.  You punch it in, and it regurgitates numbers.  Well, I'm trying to make something similar to that, but on steroids.  There will be a set of four or five different experiments that you can do.  When you punch in the data, it automatically does all the statistical work so that a clam committee doesn't have to hire a scientist or a statistician to turn around and analyze their stuff.  They can turn around, follow the directions, input it, get the result, and then make their own decisions.  


F1:        [1:43:55] That’s cool.


A:        [1:43:57] I'm trying to put it on steroids with no funding. (laughter)


F1:        [1:44:00] It’s an innovative idea. 


A:        [1:44:02] Yeah, I think it would be so much fun.  If you know it's a predator, and we know it's the number one primary predator, then let's learn more about the predator because we're not going to affect – we’re not going to be able to change that the ocean is getting more acidic, other than there are studies that – closely growing kelp to clam flats – because a lot of the nutrients they absorb are acidic nutrients.  They've actually found that it could actually locally reduce the pH and makes it better for mussels.  It's experiments with mussels right now.  I read a lot.  Most people read books or their Kindle before they go to bed.  I read scientific papers about everything. (inaudible)


F1:        [1:44:59] (laughter)


Q:        [1:45:00] That’s amazing.  Super cool.  Jess, do you have any questions before we end the interview?


F2:         [1:45:10] No, I think you guys got it all. 


Q:        [1:45:12] Great.  Well, then, I'm going to stop this.  


END OF FILE




[a]Is this a hatchery?"
"17","Q:        [0:00] So we'd like to start with how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:05] My name is Madison Maier.


Q:        [0:08] And what's your role?  What do you do here?


A:        [0:12] I manage an experimental aquaculture lease on Hurricane Island.  Hurricane Island is a nonprofit that's just southwest of Vinylhaven Island.  It's about 11 miles offshore from Rockland.  And we have a 3.2 acre experimental lease site where we are growing all sorts of things, but primarily focusing on growing and studying sea scallops.  And so I manage the farm and help run those research projects.  And then we also do some education here.  So I get to work with primarily middle school and high schoolers as well.


Q:        [0:46] Wonderful.  And we're going to come back more to asking you follow up questions about your role here, but to kind of go back first to your background.  Can you tell me about where you were born and grew up?


A:        [0:56] Yep, I grew up in Connecticut in a suburb of New York City, so right on Long Island Sound.  And I came to Maine for college.  I went to Colby College and then moved to Rockland after I graduated and have been here ever since.


Q:        [1:17] What year did you graduate?


A:        [1:18] In 2019.


Q:        [1:21] Great.  And what did your parents do and where were they from?


A:        [1:25] So my dad is from New York City, born and raised.  He worked in a bank.
And my mom grew up primarily in Florida, but her family was also from the East 
Coast.  And she was a homemaker.  So she took care of me and my siblings.


Q:        [1:47] And how many siblings do you have?


A:        [1:48] I have two older siblings.  So I'm the baby.


Q:        [1:52] And where are they?  And what do they do?


A:        [1:56] Good question.  So my older sister, Kaitlin, lives in New York City.  I’m the only one in the family that's actually not living there.  And she started her own company in woman's health.  And so if you've ever heard of uterine prolapse, my sister has recreated the pessary so it is collapsible and self-removable.  She’s pretty smart.


And then my middle sibling, Kai, (sp?) also lives in New York and does marketing and like numbers side of marketing for Bloomingdales.


Q:        [2:31] And do you have, you haven't mentioned it yet, but just to ask, do you have any history of fishing in your family?  And that could be like nuclear family or like extended family or grandparents, great-grandparents.


A:        [2:42] No.  I definitely grew up going to the water, but no history of fishing in my family.
Definitely a little bit outside of the family norm.


Q:        [2:57] And just to check, any history of anyone working in kind of supporting roles or industries such like fish processing, marketing, bait or gear?


A:        [3:06] Nope.


Q:        [3:08] Nope, none of it?  Great.  So you mentioned you went to Colby.  Could you say a little bit more about your educational background – would be like your trajectory leading up to that and what you did at Colby?


A:        [3:16] Yeah.  So yeah, went through school, high school, not really sure what my grand plans for the future were, ended up at Colby where I studied environmental science and education.  Always was really interested in the water and being on the water.  Always more interested in like working with my hands than the computer side of all of that.  


So I was able to have some cool experiences there.  A pivotal part of my college experience was that I was on the women's rugby team.  So that was a lot of really good friends and good times.


Q:        [4:06] And within your kind of environment, your studies in environmental studies, environmental ed, did you have any exposure to marine systems or what kind of sparked that or started that for you?


A:        [4:17] That probably started a lot younger.  Was never like a lap swimmer or everything, but really loved to freak out lifeguards by seeing how long I could stay under water  growing up.  So when I was in high school, I got to do basically like the last month of my senior year.  At my school, you could just go do an internship and so I worked at like a local marine nonprofit and I helped take care of all their tanks.  And so that was really fun for me and I loved that.  Loved feeding the horseshoe crabs especially.  So I knew I was interested in that.


And then in school, my summer jobs were – worked at another aquarium, environmental ed.  And then I actually started working at Hurricane Island when I was still in college as a summer intern.  And that really clicked with me, the getting to be on the ocean all the time, working, doing fun things in a good community.


Q:        [5:22] Are you married?


A:        [5:24] Nope.


Q:        [5:25] Do you have any children?


A:        [5:26] No.


Q:        [5:27] Do you – if you had children in the future, would you be interested in them going into fisheries or aquaculture?  


A:        [5:34] Yeah.  Yeah, I have no plans to leave Midcoast or Rockland area.  And – yeah.  


Q:        [5:44] So now kind of focusing more on your role here.  So I know you told us a little bit about it through the background questions, but just maybe again, how do you describe your role in the fisheries or aquaculture industry in Maine?


A:        [5:58] So I consider myself sort of like more of an aquaculture researcher than a fisheries researcher, even though some of our projects are pretty relevant to both industries.
And I think a part of that is because a big chunk of my job is just managing our farm.
And so in order for us to have any sort of relevant information or data coming out of our farm, it needs to be run to some sort of standard.  So even though we can't sell commercially, we still try and upkeep it to some commercial standards as well.
And so there's kind of the side of my job that is pretty research focused where I'm coming up with experimental designs and collecting data and setting up experiments.
And then there's kind of a part of it where I'm more just on the water working.
And then for a couple hours every week I get to hang out with students and talk to them as well, which is really fun for me.


Q:        [7:00] Great. And so you told us how you kind of ended up coming to Hurricane, I guess initially, as a college student.  How did you get into this work specifically like experimental aquaculture, like kind of yeah, can you tell us about that?


A:        [7:12] A little bit of chance for sure.  I knew that I wanted a job that let me be outside a lot, that let me work on the water that didn't require a lot of like computer time all day every day.  And I was also interested in food systems and aquaculture kind of just made sense for all of that.  And it definitely does feel like something that like I as a person who's not from Maine could get into and do myself independent of, you know, working for an organization who I manage the farm for.


Q:        [7:54] And so did you sort of learn on the job or were you kind of apprentice to somebody –


A:        [8:02] It's a lot of learning on the job.  I came in at like a big transition time.  And so for my first year, I just was figuring everything out by myself, which was wicked fun and a great way to do it.  Big learning curve to figure out what it takes to manage a farm and what it takes to manage especially a scallop farm and all the gear and maintenance.  And so pretty much all of what I've learned has been on the job.  And I mean, there's been some great, great things through that.  


I came as a diver but like really like learned how to dive here, learned how to inspect moorings, do all of that underwater work, became a much better boat driver, which is huge.  And then all of the, you know, general maintenance, what is important in like doing a research project on an aquaculture farm where you really can't control everything.  So like what, what should you be putting effort into controlling versus what should you just kind of be letting go?


Q:        [9:11] And can you tell us a little more about the farm itself, which, yeah, you've mentioned
a few things that sort of, what you're growing, how – the size and how the setup is.


A:        [9:21] So it's a 3.2 acre experimental lease off the north end of our island.  We’re permitted to grow sea scallops, oysters, mussels and kelp.  Pretty much like all of our time and space and research is focused on sea scallops.  So when I started, they had just expanded from a limited purpose aquaculture site to this larger experimental lease.
And so it's grown a lot in the time that I've been here.  And so we have scallops in bottom cages because we're relatively shallow site.  The site was chosen because it's kind of tucked in between two ledges.  And so there's like not really a boat conflict.
And it's not really a popular fishing ground.


So we keep them there because that brings them down a little bit, which is great.
And we also have two long lines – horizontal long lines underneath the water.  Ours are  about 10 to 15 feet under the water just because our site is a little shallow.  I installed that northern long line, but the more southern one was there when I started.  And off those we have a lot of lantern nets where we keep our scallops.  Also have some floating bags with oysters we'll grow crop in the winter and then also since my times here we've gotten aquaculture float with some solar on it and a mast and boom.
And all that stuff was created on island by me and my co-workers.


Q:        [10:55] And how long has aquaculture program been running?  You said some of it was here when you got here, sounds like you developed a lot of it and it’s expanded a lot.  How far back does it go?


A:        [11:04] So Hurricane started in 2013.  And I started in 2018, I believe.  And so it had been running for not since 2013, but pretty close to it.  They actually started because they were doing a research project looking for changes in like scallop settlement in a voluntary fishery closure in the Muscle Ridge Channel.  And so the idea was like if we close this really small area, will it increase the fishable scallops nearby?  And so started setting out these larval collector bags and then you end up with larval scallops in those, so what are you going to do with them?  Grow them out on a farm.


Q:        [11:55] And you mentioned an experimental lease that's here.  Do you have any other commercial fishing licenses or aquaculture licenses in your name?


A:        [12:04] Spat license to collect the larval scallops and then big hopes of having my own farm one day.


Q:        [12:12] Tell me about that one.  What's your hope?


A:        [12:17] Like to have my own farm one day.  I think I've really, really developed a love for scallops and I understand them really well.  And so I am very interested in growing scallops on a pretty, probably on a pretty small level.  And it's definitely sort of like slow thing to get into between picking a site and getting at leased and going through that whole process and making sure you have all the gear.  And so in some ways I feel like I'm at a little bit of advantage because I've made so many mistakes working for someone else that I feel a little more prepared to do it for myself.  But I think it's a good – I don't think I'll maybe ever make a full living off of it, but I think that it's a good, a good way to make a partial living and it lets me do, it would let me do
a lot of the things with my life that I want to do.  


Q:        [13:27] And for an experimental lease and what happens to the scallops you guys grow out, so you're doing experiments about growing methods, settlement – improving different things and reproduction, but yeah, what happens to the scallops?


A:        [13:42] So we aren't allowed to sell commercially off our lease because we're a scientific experimental lease, not a commercial experimental lease.  And so the difference there is that ours is renewable.  And so some of our – a good chunk of our experiments require tissue condition checks, which basically means that post-experiment we need to dissect the scallops to see if it had any positive or negative or no effect on how they were growing in their health.  So that's kind of a big way we get off of, we sort of get rid of scallops.


Q:        [14:16] Could you comment it all on just the scallop industry, whether or not it’s certainly not as big as other aspects of sort of shellfish aquaculture in Maine.  It's newer.          Yeah, could you just comment on sort of like where the industry is at in the state and
sort of, yeah.


A:        [14:31] Yeah, I don't think that the scallop fishery in Maine, the state fishery is going anywhere and I also don't think that scallop aquaculture is going to replace the fishery at all.  We have a pretty healthy fishery.   It collapsed in the ‘90s and has since kind of switched management strategies.  And it's going like well, like I don't think that we should close our scallop fishery, need to close our scallop fishery anything like that.  I just think that one of the things about scallop aquaculture is that it can't necessarily compete with the wild fishery from like a output standard or anything like that, but it can offer different things in the fishery.


So the Dayboat Fishery in Maine is a winter fishery, so you can only get fresh scallops
in the winter.  They have a size requirement.  Aquaculture scallops don't have a size requirement and there's also the possibility for you to sell the whole animal in aquaculture.  So it's like a requirement in the fishery that you shuck them at sea and you only land the meat, which is what you, you know, we'll see on your plate or at the grocery store or anything like that, but it's a whole animal and the whole animal is edible.


But we have an issue with like toxins and closures in Maine.  So things like paralytic shellfish poisoning or amnesic shellfish poisoning and scallops are considered to be really slow detoxifiers, so they hold on to all of that in their body tissues for a really long time, but not in the muscle that we eat.  That's why they make them all the fishermen shuck them at sea, only land the meat and because they hold on to them for a long time and because scallops are really good swimmers – when you're fishing for them, you don't know where they were.  So you never know whether they're safe to eat unless you test each individual scallop for those toxins, which is not really feasible.


In cultured scallops, you know exactly where they've been the whole time and you know that they've all been eating the same food.  And so you can do testing with the Department of Marine Resources to see if they're safe to eat and if they are, you can sell the whole animal.  Often you're selling them much smaller because if you're selling a wild scallop, that would be like a wild scallop size, that would be a really big mouthful.  And so they're, you know, more like a two-ish, two-and-a-half-inch shell height and you can cook them up just like mussels, eat them, they're delicious.  And you can also sell even just the meats year round.  And so you can kind of differ in the product that you're offering from the wild fishery, which I also think is important.


Q:        [17:21] Yeah, thank you, really interesting.  A few more questions just about sort of your background and experience in fisheries or aquaculture in general.  So obviously, you're managing the farm and so you may cover different roles here.  So I'm just going to kind of prompt you and say whether you feel like that describes work you have done in the past.  Do you have any experience in fisheries or aquaculture in relation to bookkeeping, bait, or gear preparation?


A:        [17:50] Yes.


Q:        [17:51] Yes, tell me about that.


A:        [17:53] All sorts.  So – yeah, all of it.  I manage pretty much all of the gear on our farm and so that's, you know, building bags which are the same as oyster bags, repairing lantern nets when they rip.  All that.  We keep our lantern nets off of loops because if you put them on a single line, it will unlay (sp?) real bad.  So, you know, splicing all the loops and getting those ready and all of that.  I kind of head up and it's also a lot of like maintaining the farm under water.  So I'm a diver.  And so inspecting all the gear, replacing it as needed, all the lines and chains and shackles and everything.  It's actually a part of my job that I really love.  It's really fun.  And yeah, then maintaining the boat, keeping it up.  


Aquaculture, like everything we know about scallop aquaculture pretty much has come from Japan.  They have like very different boats, very different co-op style for aquaculture than we have here.  And so it's a lot of like taking their technology and trying to transfer it to Maine and like what we need in these waters and how our boats work.  


And so my work boat is a 24 foot Carolina Skiff.  And that has come into creation since I have started.  And so my end goal for the farm is to not have to lift anything heavy because when I started out, I was like hand hauling my cages, hand hauling my long line up to reach my lantern nets and it just – back breaking labor that is like in no way sustainable for anyone in the long term.  And so I've worked on like making a lot of the systems and equipment we have, we have some specialized gear on our boat that was like custom made, I helped design.  And then I had a coworker weld up.  I just learned how to weld last winter.  And so I'm going to make some new stuff for us of this winter, which I'm really excited for.  We need a new stern davit just because our gears – we have more gear, it's heavier than it used to be as we continue to expand.
And so I want to beef up some of that.  Yeah, I really like the gear side of things.


Q:        [20:30] Yeah, that’s great, how about in terms of experience in post-harvest processing, marketing or trade.  


A:        [20:34] Not so much, because we're not a commercial farm.  We don’t market anything like that. 


Q:        [20:40] What about in terms of education, advocacy or community based organizations related to fisheries and agriculture.  


A:        [20:47] Yeah.  So we have, we have like our own programs on Hurricane that I work with.  And so a big, yeah, a part of my job is definitely showing people the farm, talking about our farm with them.  We try and have our students engage in something interesting and hands on.  And so the way that you collect sea scallops for a farm, because there's no hatchery is by setting out spat bags or like larval collector bags.
Of course, they're just in the ocean for months on end.  So it's not only scallops in there.  And so we'll have like kids sort through them, see what they can find, count all the scallops.  And that's like a fun, more fun, engaging way to kind of talk about our work and aquaculture and all of that.  


And so I do a lot of work with primarily middle school and high schoolers.  I've also started a program out here for adult workshops.  And so we do – starting three years ago we do like one day adult workshops.  And some of them are like an intro to aquaculture thing of just if you want to come out and you want to learn about something, you're welcome too.  And some of them are a little bit more like skill or workforce focused.  And so a lot of those have guest speakers too, which is really fun.  So we've had some about site selection.  We've had some about like fabrication, like small scale aquaculture fabrication, a really wide variety of things.  And they're all free, and open to anyone.


Q:        [22:33] Great.  What about in terms of research and development?


A:        [22:37] Yes.  So yeah, the whole kind of point of our farm is demonstration farm and then also research.  And so we do a really wide variety of experiments on the farm.  Some of them are like internal experiments and so that basically means that like Hurricane comes up with the idea and the funding.  And we do it all.  Some of them are like farmer collaborations and so we work with other aquaculture farmers to test out – often its gear.  That's really great.


        We're definitely a different site than a lot of places, especially oyster farms, which
there are so many of in Maine.  We're pretty far out into Pen Bay, pretty exposed, very cold, very salty.  And a lot of the oyster farms are a lot more tucked into shore and rivers and coves all of that.  And so it can be interesting to kind of see how different gear or growing methods interact in different spaces.  


And then we do some like larger collaborative projects with like other nonprofits or research institutions.  And so I was just kind of talking about spat bags to collect larval scallops and one of our projects is working with scallop fishermen to set spat bags up and down the coast of Maine to try and get a better understanding of like where scallops are settling, in what quantities because that's not really well understood, they're population dynamics.  Because they spend a really long time in their larval phase in the water column and so they can travel really far.  


Q:        [24:24] Can I ask a specific one because another interview we did was with Ocean Farm Supply and I mentioned the experiment's going on here with using their beach, their compostable mesh bags.  And yeah, could you say a little bit about that?  They said they're putting them – it's about helping the biofouling impact.  


A:        [24:43] Yep.  So we're working with Erin from Ocean Farm Supply.  And she has basically like created this materic – net, like totally (inaudible) fibre material made out of beechwood.  So it's like totally compostable.  And we're using it to cover our lantern nets like a sock.  And so they come in these big flat sheets and you tie it at the top of the bottom and then you sew it up, sew up the seam.  And the idea behind it is basically as like a sacrificial component of the lantern net and so the most time intensive and gear intensive and everything intensive part of running a farm can often be cleaning off biofouling.  And that's been changing a lot even since I've been here and things are way heavier than they used to be.  So the idea behind this is that you put it out, things will settle on to that compostable mesh instead of on the lantern net itself.  And then it will basically just like fall off and decompose on the seafloor.  


So first year testing that out looks like it's working, which is really great.  And so the nets are looking cleaner.  These haven't even been tested in saltwater yet.  And so part of the experiment this year has also just been like how long do they last.  So we've been setting them out for like about a month at a time and seeing what happens.  And then we've had a few that we've had out for basically the whole summer to see how that  changes.  But going out, collecting biofouling data every week, you know, at the end we do the tissue conditions of the sample, see if it impacted water flow and made them grow slower or anything like that.  .


Q:        [26:29] That’s really cool.  And do you have any experience working in hatcheries?  You don’t need hatcheries for scallops.


A:        [26:39] No, people are trying to figure out scallop hatchery.  There's been like a research project going on for a few years where Mook Sea Farm, Darling Marine Center and Down East Institute are trying to basically figure out how they can have a scallop hatchery.  And we give them adult scallops for that work, but I'm not involved in the hatchery side of it beyond oohing and aahing over, you know, little baby scallops.   


Q:        [27:08] And then in terms of seafood, do you have any experience in the food service, food preparation, customer interface side like shucking oysters, things like that?  Great.


        Could you describe for us like what does an average day – which might be hard and you can pock a couple different seasons if you want as it’s helpful – what an average day and work looks like for you.


A:        [27:29] Yeah.  An average day is hard.  I have more of average weeks, but I often spend a pretty good chunk of my time just on the farm doing whatever general maintenance needs to happen.  And so that might look like me heading out, going out to our long line, bringing in some dirty nets.  We bring those into our float to process them basically.  And so emptying out all those nets, sorting through the scallops, making sure they're looking good, putting them into clean nets back out onto the long line and then cleaning the nets themselves.  


Often we'll pressure wash them, we have like an electric pressure washer which actually works pretty well.  But we've also done hot tanks and things like that.  We have to bring out a propane stove for that because I'm on a little Carolina Skiff.  So that's the bummer.  But it works very well for like the days when we're really out there for a long time.   


Often I have like a day of data collection in my week.  That kind of depends a lot on what our projects are, but it's usually going out and a lot of our projects are gear based.
And so seeing whether biofouling is growing and what's growing, checking to see if there's any damage to gear, things like that.  And then the experiment setup and take down is definitely more of a time intensive project because people often need scallops of a certain size or scallops of a certain sex and so I'll do like a lot of prep work for to find everything we would need for that.  The underwater farm maintenance is definitely not an everyday task.  That's a little bit more rare.  And then I often do a few lessons a week with visitors.  And so that might be sorting through a spat bag.  A lot of times we'll do farm tours.  So they'll come out and hang out on our float and like get to actually see the farm itself.  It’s real fun.


Q:        [29:42] Thank you.  How do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing and aquaculture sector including how others perceive or treat you?


A:        [29:56] Definitely think there's a big component of being from away.  So I've have seen that a lot in how I interact with other people.  Kind of the longer I've been here – impact I’ve make the less it’s impacted me.  You still hear it a lot of what are you doing here?  Doesn't really bother me too much.  And I think that there's definitely been – there's in some ways I think that there's some benefits of being a woman in aquaculture in other ways I think it's made my job a little harder.  I definitely like see the stereotype of lady scientist a lot which is an interesting one that I like didn't really know existed until I got into the like aquaculture and the like little bit fisheries research work in Maine, which I definitely do a lot of research work but I don't always consider myself a scientist.  


So it’s interesting to see how other people see me.  And within my work itself we often hire between one and three other people to help out with the research team on Hurricane.  Some of them are more focused on the farm.  Some of them are more focused on education.  Some of them are more focused on like research and data and all of that.  We almost only get female applicants so I end up working on  – like pretty much every year I've been here, this is my seventh summer, I have worked on a predominantly female team which is great.  Strong communication out on the farm –works out well.


Q:        [32:01] And how does your role in the fishing and aquaculture sector work with any family or caregiving responsibilities you might have?


A:        [32:10] One of the harder components of like this specific job is that I'm living out on an island
for half the year.  So this is my first year working here where I've had a year round rental because of course housing in Midcoast is always a fun time to try and figure out so in the past I've always done just winter rentals and that was especially really hard in any sort of interaction with anyone off island because I didn't really have a place to stay.  So I would just end up spending most of my time living out on Hurricane.  Now that I have a year round place that balance has gotten a bit easier which is really great.
And so for me it's like a little bit less.  Any struggles that I have are a little less about working on the water with the exception of large weather events which just consume your life until they're over.  And a little more like just my job is remote.


Q:        [33:23] What about any like future plans in terms of like the family or work life balance?  How do you see that working out in the future?


A:        [33:32] Definitely have had that question.  I think that it would be really hard for me to do my job pregnant.  You know part of my job is underwater, can't dive.  So need to find someone else to do that.  Lot of my, you know, I've come up with a lot of the systems to decrease the heavy labor but you really can't get rid of it all.  Because I've been here so long I am able to do a lot of the work by myself which like not all my coworkers can do just because I like kind of get the systems really well – would definitely not be able to do that pregnant.  And then just with like caregiving too that's definitely a big question of like, yeah, I don't want to toddler on a float with moving heavy things overhead.


And so that's a question that I've had for myself and I don't know the answer for.  I think that it wouldn't stop me from, it wouldn't force me to leave aquaculture forever and it working in aquaculture wouldn't stop me from having a family but it adds, it adds a lot of logistics.  


Q:        [34:50] Yeah and I just realized I skipped actually from way back, let’s go back for a second,  what year were you born?


A:        [34:56] It's born in 1997.


Q:        [34:57] OK, wonderful, thank you.  OK, so shifting to kind of environmental changes you’ve observed – experienced in your time out here, yeah, can you describe any of those changes you notice in the marine environment since you've been working in the industry?


A:        [35:13] A big one is biofouling so like I was saying a really time consuming part of my job is clearing all of our gear.  And what we've had growing on the gear has just the timing –just the volume and I have only been doing this for seven years.  Really so not even that long and really the grand scheme of things but we've definitely been seeing a lot more tunicates or like sea squirts, all sorts of them both the like sea squirt singular ones and the like spreading colonial mats. (sp?)  Those are really heavy so that's fun.  And that's probably one of the bigger differences and then in talking with other farmers they've kind of been seeing a lot of new things as well.


More hydroids so like the little hairs with like the little colorful dots on the end of them
and all sorts.  And that has definitely had to change how I also do my job so I used to
kind of be able to like do a couple big cleans a year and that's it and now it's just like
we're cleaning every week.  And part of that is like we've you know changed kind of to do that we no longer take a dedicated huge chunk of time and only clean, but yeah I can I can barely keep up with it.  Also it kind of impacts like how the farm is run just because the gear gets that much heavier that much quicker and so I need to either continue to add buoyancy so like add more gear to my farm which I like to try and not to do that whenever I can.  I think simpler solutions are usually the best like the least amount of gear you can have means that the least amount of things can break or I need to decrease the amount of gear I have on my lines.  


Q:        [37:22] And removal looks like hauling up putting it on the boat or a float.  And you said power washing or a heat tank.  So it's not like oysters where they air (inaudible).  


A:        [37:34] Yeah, yeah scallops are pretty dramatic little creatures so they really hate to be crowded so you also can't really put them very full so you need more gear than you would if you're comparatively growing something like a oyster.  They like typically cover only like 20 to 30% of the bottom of the gear, which is not that much.  And they're really sensitive to being left out in the sun to too warm of water.  They don't even like fog so like a foggy day you have to be careful how long (inaudible).  So it's a lot of moving gear back and forth.


Q:        [38:15] A lot of labor.


A:        [38:16] A lot of labor.


Q:        [38:17] In terms of things you've tried in response to cope with or adapt to the increase in
biofouling you've mentioned changes to the process like often shifting from a few big cleans to just more regular.  And I guess going back earlier to the research and development side you're researching the potential of sort of sacrificial biodegradable
bag.  Is there anything else that you're trying or anything else you've done in response to the biofouling?  
  
A:        [38:44] Those are all the big ones.  Yeah.  I mean in addition I guess the other thing to know with all of that stuff is that in order to not have all of our little critters out somewhere unhappy we've also like just had to buy more gear so we can do that swapping in and out more re efficiently.


Q:        [39:10] And how do those things that you've tried in response been helping?  Like you feel like they're working?


A:        [39:17] I think they are working. I just don't really see, I just think that this is going to keep happening and I don't think that they're going to work forever.  Like I think we're just going to need to keep coming up with more ideas and I don't think that the most sustainable solution is going to be to just throw more people at it.  Because that costs money, a lot of time resource and so trying to think of other ways to keep this gear cleaner for longer.  Like these experimental covers would be great. 


Q:        [39:58] Yeah, because that's not necessarily more labor intensive.


A:        [40:03] Yeah.


Q:        [40:04] Yeah.  Great.  And what has made it possible for you to kind of make those changes on your farm to kind of adapt to the increase in biofouling, for example, are there any resources, relationships, knowledge, training, or organizations that you've drawn kind of figuring out how to respond?


A:        [40:20] Yeah.  Marsden Brewer and his son Bobby are scallop farmers over in Stonington.
He has been so incredibly helpful in learning everything I need to learn.  He was like a collaborator so we would go to his farm every week to get scallops for an experiment.  I learned driving over in the fog.  But he has been incredibly helpful in like figuring out ideas, what to do, anything like that.  So he has been a huge resource.  And I mean, I think that one of the other things that makes it so possible is that we're not a commercial farm.  


So how much money I make is not based on like what end product I have and how much I'm selling and how much I'm selling it for.  I just like have a steady paycheck.  And so that has really helped.  And it also means that I can try and get additional people to help.  When I first started out here it was me and one other person for just the summer.  And now we have me, two full season people and then someone, in intern, who is here for just the summer.  So part of that is because we were like a really young organization and all of our work has expanded so we have more work to do.  But part of it is that managing the farm is a lot more work than it was.  When I started there wasn't a farm manager, which is what my role is.  


Q:        [42:02] And what about – I guess I'm thinking again of the Ocean Farm Supply kind of connection, kind of what precipitated, what made that possible to kind of get that out here and to be testing it on the farm?


A:        [42:16] I don't know who formed that connection originally.  But I mean, that's kind of like what our goal is to do for some of our experiments.  We have this experimental farm.
We have staff who are trained to do data collection.  We have boats.  We have resources.  We have scallops.  And so it worked out real well of like this is a project that we're really interested in because if it works, it'll help us.  If it works, it's like a more sustainable option to some of our cleaning alternatives.  And we were able to get a grant from the Nature Conservancy to fund some of that work.  


Q:        [43:10] And so biofouling is the biggest one – the one you brought right away easily.  Are there – kind of going back to that question can you describe changes in the marine environment you've noticed anything else come up in addition to the biofouling for you?


A:        [43:23] I think storms definitely are part of it.  So like bad winter storms, but also kind of bad full year round storms now.  To put our farm away for the winter, basically we sink all of our floating oysters and we move our float to – tucked into a cove over by Greens Island.  And it stays in the water year round.  And so there's still a worry of like we've tucked away everything we can.  But what will that look like when we come back?  


And so after the January storms this year I came out to check on the farm.  Other hard thing is that there's only so much I can do in the middle of winter, you know, we are 11 miles offshore.  You could live out on this island in the winter, but you're bringing out all of your water, bringing out all of your food, heating with a wood stove in an un-insulated cabin, so doable, but just not doable, super long term.  And so luckily this time we really didn't have any damage, but how much is there that I can do in the winter.


And so that's definitely like a worry that I have.  And we definitely have now started considering replacing things that before we were like, oh, they're fine.  The last, we're not at the end of their life cycle.  I still do think that, but I'm also like kind of considering it up against continued forces as long as I thought.  And then it just changes kind of the infrastructure we have here.  So our pier washed away.  And so just means that, you know, we're loading everything by carrying down the ramp to our float.  So doable, just a little more time, a little more labor.


Q:        [45:25] Is there much you can or have tried to kind of adapt to the increase in storms in terms of and process or gear?


A:        [45:35] Not much.  We are now more prepared to move everything or really like before we used to just basically put things away and move them when we were done for the season out here.  So October-ish, now I have some more contingency plans and phone numbers and all of that of, you know, can I leave my, can I push my float and leave it on your mooring for the next three days during the storm?  Where we keep it tucked into Greens is really tidal so it's like not a great last minute emergency spot.  So kind  of had to build up the, what are our more temporaries?  There's not really a whole bunch you can do.  We're pretty exposed, we are between two ledges, but we're also way out in Pen Bay. So.


Q:        [46:32] And so in addition to biofouling, storms, any other environmental changes you want to tell us about the impacting the farm?


A:        [46:47] I can't think of any right now.  I’ll probably think of some later.


Q:        [46:51] And what about, we talked a lot of – I mean, I know probably these changes impact the whole farm, but we talked a lot about the scallops.  Anything I guess that comes up differently for like the oyster, mussel or kelp farming aspect of the farm?


A:        [47:03] Oysters are mostly just making sure that they're tucked away for all of our storms.
Because we don't sell our eats I don't have all of the same worries as a lot of other farmers do.  So there's been a lot of closures this summer.  But again, because I just have a city paycheck regardless of what I'm selling, it's like less of a worry for me personally.  But I mean, I see it and I still stress out.  And so whether it's a rainfall event or like closures for toxins and like different harmful algal blooms and all that, that's definitely been kind of on the rise.  


And honestly, our kelp is always a little bit sad because we often do it as a classroom kind of lesson.  And so students will set it out in the fall and harvest it in the spring.  It's pretty delicate, because you really can't touch it.  But telling middle schoolers to not touch something doesn't always go that well.  So we've definitely had some poor kelp harvests, but I think that's a little bit more to do with the deployment than climate change.  


But we have tried to find sorus tissue to spawn our own kelp because that's also – it doesn't always make the most sense for a commercial farmer to do because it's pretty gear intensive.  It's like kind of hard to do.  It's really particular and if you mess up, what's your plan?  But it's really fun to do the kids in a classroom and we have been having – like finding the sorus tissue, like the reproductive tissue of the kelp.  The timing has been all wonky and we've had a really hard time with that in recent years.


Q:        [48:54] And do you think is that linked to ocean temperature?


A:        [48:57] It’s temperature, yeah.


Q:        [48:59] Yeah.  And then in terms of, we told us some things you've tried, you've changed and been able to adapt to you, but are there things you would like to try to adapt to the changes you’re experiencing that you haven't been able to yet?


A:        [49:14] Yeah.  I would love to see some more – how can I think about this?  Yeah.
I'd love to see like keep trying out new things like Erin Adams biodegradable covers,
to mitigate biofouling, like I'd love to try and see more sort of like one-time labor
efforts.  That will decrease the amount that you need to clean on the farm and I would also love to like continue to have our farm keep getting organized and more streamlined because all of that also saves us time and effort.  And kind of – we have a solar cube out there.  And so it would be great to continue to see some like gear adapt to electric because luckily we're way out here, I don't really have an issue getting permission to use a pressure washer on our farm.  Often people do, because they’re too noisy.  So continuing to see like all that stuff, continue – continue to adapt.


Q:        [50:42] What is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future of Maine’s  fisheries and aquaculture industries?  


A:        [50:50] Just that will change so much and people won't be ready to adapt.  I think that it's going to look different and it already looks so different than what it used to be and I think it will continue to look so different than what it was.  And I think that timing is going to change and so like fisheries will change, like aquaculture will change when you're going to be allowed to harvest things and sell things will change as human health impacts change and growth areas change and reproduction habits change.  And I worry that the management isn't going to adapt fast enough.  I think that people are really clever.  I think that there's a lot of people have a lot ideas of like what they can do now and what they could do in the future and that like, especially people who work on the water are pretty, pretty adaptive.


But I worry that we as the management won't be able to keep up with everything that happened so quickly.


Q:        [52:09] If you could tell policymakers in Maine what the biggest priority should be, just sort
to help people adapt to these changes, what would you tell them?


A:        [52:24] I think that adaptive management fisheries make sense and I think that cultured species and I think that there's like some very good and strong intentions for there to be adaptive management strategies.  But I think that’s staffing and input and all of that is like not there and that that process should be reassessed and given more resources.


Q:        [52:54] Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training programs for fisheries or aquaculture?


A:        [53:07] Like what?  I was like, no, I don't think so.  


Q:        [53:14] It's been an over (multiple conversations; inaudible). 


A:        [53:16] Interesting. 


Q:        [53:17] What strategies do you think would be effective in terms of kind of maybe trainings to help build resilience against climate-related impacts in fisheries or aquaculture?


A:        [53:29] I think you need more people and I think you need different people.  Not to get rid of the people that are currently in it but just to expand.  I think that there's a really, I think that breaking into the Maine waterfront as someone from away is real hard but I also am not planning on leaving.  And I think that there's a lot of people who feel pretty similar to me and I think that like just ideas and people are kind of going to be what's needed to figure it out in the future.  


Q:        [54:12] New ideas and new people.  Great, thank you.  Now in terms of not only environmental change but just kind of other changes, are there other types of changes that are impacting your work on the farm that you want to tell us about?


A:        [54:32] I don't think so.  


Q:        [54:38] Can you tell me about any opportunities or maybe positive changes you've experienced
in the industry during your time?


A:        [54:47] Lots.  I've learned so much from so many different people and that's been really awesome.  I've made some really strong friendships and strong relationships throughout.  It definitely was in a bit of a go-forth and figure it out situation and like I said at the beginning, I've made a lot of mistakes working for someone else.  I would have made way more mistakes if I didn't have the help I had.  Other farmers, like the Brewers out of Stonington were really key.  A couple of fishermen out of Vinalhaven really helped me out and figuring out what I needed getting me in any instances where I did have gear issues like getting me phone numbers so I could just call people and talk to them.  And that was really essential for the success of this experimental farm.


Q:        [55:57] What is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine’s coastal fisheries and aquaculture industries?


A:        [56:10] That we still have all of our fisheries so everything that we have now, I want it to stay. Fisheries that we've had in the past that have closed I would love to see re-open.  Of course all of these animals are moving and doing new things and different things and we've had population collapses and so I also hope that as new species come to Maine,  which we're already starting to see, we can turn those into valuable fishery and culture operations.


Q:        [56:45] What are some of those new species you thinking of?


A:        [56:48] (inaudible) we got blue crab, now, are they going to keep coming.
.
Q:        [56:51] (inaudible)?


A:        [56:52] I haven't seen one yet.  But I've gotten sent some pictures of them.  Are they going to keep coming?  What's going to happen?  People are seeing different new fish, different amounts of fish.  I hope that those turn into strong fisheries for people.  I also hope  that aquaculture stays kind of more on the owner operator.  A lot of the aquaculture in Maine I hope stays in the more owner operator level because I think that that is kind of what makes sense with Maine's heritage and Maine's coastal heritage.  I think that that's a really big part of Maine's working waterfront identity is the owner operator model and I hope that aquaculture can kind of stay within that.


Q:        [57:57] Have you noticed changes in women's presence, participation or status in fisheries or aquaculture over time?


A:        [58:08] I'm not sure if I've noticed changes but I definitely – myself – and have talked to others
as a woman, have felt like aquaculture is easier to break into than a fishery.  So I see more women in aquaculture.


Q:        [58:30] Can you say why you or others feel like it's easier?


A:        [58:35] Yeah.  I mean part of it of course is like I'm from away.  I don't have – will get my lobster license.  Good Stern. (sp?)  There's definitely like both me and some of my girlfriends who've sterned (sp?) before are a little bit more careful of like who do I want to work for, all of that.  I still think there's the same interest in like working for yourself and I think that it just feels more achievable.  It feels like more acceptable also.  And I think that it helps too that there's a push for workforce development because I often find that I really like to know things before I do them.  I'll try – mess up whatever, but also if there's an option to try and learn something first, I'll go for it and I often have gone to both related to aquaculture and totally unrelated to whatever else to like different trainings and free opportunities and stuff like that.  And I definitely feel like it's almost all women.


Q:        [1:00:04] You mentioned sterning.  I just wanted to clarify.  Have you sterned in the past?


A:        [1:00:07] No.


Q:        [1:00:08] OK.  But you know people.


A:        [1:00:09] Some of my friends.


Q:        [1:00:11] Do they have observations, you said something about being careful which boats they go on – what the barriers can be like or how it could be different in aquaculture to working and capture fishing?  


A:        [1:00:24] Can you say that again?


Q:        [1:00:27] I was – start thinking about being careful about which boats they go on.


A:        [1:00:32] Yeah, just in conversation, like casual conversations, it's just a little bit more of like trying to make sure that you know someone in common who you can be like out there, they're all good.  There'll be a fine person to work for which I do not hear that happening as much amongst my guy friends that are fishing.  Yeah.  That concerns a little bit more like how much of a hard ass are they from the guys.  


Q:        [1:01:11] One last other kind of newer species I was just curious – you mentioned blue crabs made me think of it – do green crabs pose any problems on your farm or –


A:        [1:01:23] Not really.  So our gears in – like all of our scallops are in gear and so they're definitely vulnerable when they're like itty bitty tiny.  We keep them off the bottom in bags basically and so we haven't had huge issues with green crabs predation like other culture where they're like actually seeding into the mud or anything like that.  We haven't really had that but I definitely see the green crabs on my gear and I've definitely
found dead scallops but often by the time that they're small enough to get into the gear
they're not a huge threat and if the gear is big enough for them to get into the animals
inside are pretty large and so they're hard to kill.  


Q:        [1:02:14] So they're in there sometimes but they're not posing a big predation issue?  Is there anything else you wanted to share with us in this interview?


A:        [1:02:16] I don’t think so.


Q:        [1:02:19] (inaudible) did you want to add anything (inaudible)?  OK, wonderful. 


END OF FILE"
"18","Q:        [0:00] And we'd like to start with just how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:04] I typically go by Essie.  My full name is Esther, which is a great name to use at the bank, but yeah, Essie is my name.


Q:        [0:12] Great, and what year were you born?


A:        [0:14] I was born in 1999.


Q:        [0:16] And can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:19] Yeah, I grew up in mid-coast Maine.  I grew up in Bremen, Maine, which is sort of down the peninsula from Damariscotta.  There's a lot of fishermen who live there, so I grew up on the school bus with a bunch of fishermen's kids which was really quite fun.  There was a lot of spitballs and stuff like that.  But yeah, growing up in Maine was a dream.  I was a little bit of a feral child by some standards, always barefoot.  But yeah, I loved it.  I was always interested in bugs and critters and that sort.  And Maine was a good place to find those.


Q:        [0:54] Absolutely.  And can you tell me a little bit about your parents where they're from, maybe what they did when you were growing up?


A:        [0:58] Yeah, my parents, neither of them is from Maine.  My mom partially grew up in Maine, but she mostly grew up – she was a faculty kid on the campus of Hackley School, which is in upstate New York.  And my dad grew up in the South.  And they both –my mom was a stay-at-home mom until I was about 10, and then she became a children's librarian.  And now she's a writer, and she works at the high school that I went to, Lincoln Academy, which contrary to its name, is technically a public school.  And my dad has always worked in economics.  He's a data analyst for data that informs tax policy that's angled that helping lower income Mainers.  So yeah, he works for the Maine Center for Economic Policy.


Q:        [1:47] Great.  And what brought them to Maine, do you know?


A:        [1:49] My mom's parents moved here after they stopped working at Hackley.  And my– so my parents originally moved to Mississippi when they first got married, because my dad wanted to give back to the community where he grew up.  And my mom is, you know, sort of from the Northeast, and that didn't really fly for her.  And so my dad was looking for a similar, like, small community that he could really work closely with.  And there was a job that was open in Maine, and also my mom's parents are here.  And everything sort of all worked out, and we ended up moving to Damariscotta when I was like three, so I wasn't born in Maine, but I like to claim it as my own whenever possible.


Q:        [2:31] Great.  And do you have any siblings?


A:        [2:32] I do.  I have a younger brother.  His name is JoJo.  He also loves Maine.  He's worked in marine construction, and he's a big whitewater kayaker so all the rivers here are great for him.  He's a musician, and he's in school right now.


Q:        [2:49] Great.  Do you have any other siblings?


A:        [2:51] Just the one.  Yep.


Q:        [2:53] And do you have any history of fishing or working on the water in your family?


A:        [2:57] Not in my family, no.  I'm the first.


Q:        [2:59] Great.  And this could include – just to a double check, grandparents, cousins, relatives, family friends.


A:        [3:08] Nope.  Just me.  


Q:        [3:10] And can you describe for me a little bit your educational background?


A:        [3:14] Yeah.  So I went to public schools in Maine through my senior year of high school, and then I went to Bates College for four years.  I have a degree in geology with concentrations in chemistry and creative writing.  Yeah.


Q:        [3:30] Nice.  And are you married?


A:        [3:32] I'm not married.  No.


Q:        [3:35] Do you have any children?


A:        [3:36] I do not have any children.


Q:        [3:38] Great.  I'm going to sort of transition.


        I'm curious if you could take me from your experience at Bates to the modern day, sort of with like timeline with question in mind – how would you describe your current role in the fishing or aquaculture industry in Maine?


A:        [3:55] Yeah.  So when I was a freshman at Bates, I was applying for summer internships looking at doing marine research.  And I ended up sort of by happenstance in the Brady Lab at the University of Maine, which is based at the Darling Marine Center doing a project on oyster aquaculture and I just fell in love.  I was working at the Bremen Lobster Pound and in that space, I was interacting with fishermen and scientists and aquaculturists and marine policy people like the DMR folks and it was just this amazing, like I loved going through a day and being able to talk to all sorts of kind of people who were all working towards this goal of working on the water and incorporating that into their daily lives.  


And since then, I've been doing aquaculture – mostly research.  So I spent a couple years at the Darling Marine Center as an undergrad, both in the summers.  And then I took a year off during COVID and I was there during COVID.  And then after I graduated, I got a job out at Hurricane Island and that was really great because there was an experimental sea farm right there.  I got to really experience like working on the water in that capacity and keeping the sea farm up to like nearly commercial standard because we wanted our research to be as close to commercial fisheries as possible, but also being out in the bay, interacting with again, fishermen and farmers and the like.  


I also had the opportunity to work on a kelp farm through like connections at the Darling Marine Center.  And so I did that for four years, I think.  And that was with Peter Fischer and Seth Barker on like – I think it was the original.  I don't think their farm was the original, but it's on the original like LPA plot in Clark's Cove in the Damariscotta River.  So that was kind of a cool piece of history and there they're like some of the OGs of kelp farming and being with them on the water was still one of my best experiences to date. 
 
So after Hurricane Island I've transitioned to being in more of the commercial scene on the scallop farming side of things.  And so I'm now working for Andrew Peters at Vertical Bay doing commercial scallop farming and it's this really interesting point in the scallop farming world from my point of view where it’s still a really new industry and so not a ton of people kind of understand what it’s all about and even we every day are like what are we doing?  I don't really know.  But we're figuring it out and we're starting to actually really sell to commercial restaurants and getting that piece of things working so that the farm is actually making money and functioning and we’re getting our systems down and it's very exciting.  So  yeah.


Q:        [6:46] So how many total years now have you been working like with and on the water?


A:        [6:53] Since 2018.


Q:        [6:55] Wow.  And what like hooked you – what made you want to do it?


A:        [7:00] I mean so many things.  I've always loved the ocean since I was a kid.  I remember I used to go down – my grandparents live in Brooklin Maine and they have this piece of property that sneaks down to this cove and I used to sneak down to the cove – I was probably eight.  I was really young.  I would steal matches and I would sneak down to the cove and I'd collect little blue mussels and make a fire and eat the blue mussels and that was like my rebellious little eight year old activity.  So I always sort of had that in me.  But actually feeling like I was being involved in the solution of a lot of this stuff.  


I think like one thing that aquaculture holds for me is so much of the research that I was a part of before getting into aquaculture was like climate change, doomsday predictions, all of that stuff.  And it was – it felt important but it also felt really difficult.  And I think the thing that I love most about aquaculture is that it feels really solutions driven.  We're reacting in real time to what's happening on our coast and saying well actually, you know, there are other ways to do this and ways that are regenerative and all of that.  So I think I think that's like the big idea of what hooked me.  But I also love the day to day just being on boats.  It's – I love boats.


Q:        [8:30] What do you love about boats? 


A:        [8:31] I love the problem solving aspect.  Every day is a little bit different.  You never know when the tide and the wind are – what they're doing.  And I love tying knots.
It's like a really small thing but I really enjoy it.  I actually really like getting muddy.  There's always a – like since I was a kid there's always been this joke like Essie’s the muddiest kid on the playground and that that continues to be true at Vertical Bay.  But – yeah.


Q:        [8:54] And can you tell me a little bit about the work you do at Vertical Bay?


A:        [8:58] Yeah.  I'm just like a regular old deckhand.  And it's great.  We get – I wake up at 4:00 every morning, I make my blueberry smoothie and then I walk actually down to the water, which is really lovely.  It's like the most peaceful part of my day.
I say hi to Sheila the skunk.  And we get on the boat at like 4:50 and take off for Cape Rosier, which is where our aquaculture site is.  Usually there's work to be done on the boat on the way out whether it's cleaning up gear from the day or taking little twine out of the lines that we use or what be it.  And then we're day to day everything's different.  And that's part of what I love about it.


Some days we're harvesting, some days we're cleaning, some days we're ear hanging.  That's a really cool thing that we're figuring out how to do at Vertical Bay is growing scallops on lines rather than in nets and it's just it's really dynamic and it – the sense of place that I feel when I'm doing this kind of work is pretty incredible. 


Q:        [10:03]  So can you tell me a little bit more about like how you grow the scallops?


A:        [10:09] Yeah.  So at Vertical Bay we're doing something that's called ear hanging.
And so we take we collect scallops spat, so this is a whole process in and of itself.
In the oyster aquaculture industry there's a hatchery so you can grow baby oysters in basically a lab setting but scallops are really finicky.  I like to tell kids that they're the divas of the bivalve world.  And so they have a 40 day planktonic stage before they start to put on shell, which means that they're really hard to keep alive in that hatchery setting.  And so aquaculturists have figured out is that you can actually collect wild spat.  And so we set out what are called these spat bags that have a like a fine mesh bag with a harder like substrate inside and what happens is the larval scallops they swim in when they're still small enough to fit through that mesh and they land on the substrate and they say, oh this is like a rocky bottom I can start to live here and they put down their byssal threads and they start to put on shell.  And then by the time we collect those bags they're what you’d recognize as a scallop.  They’re very small, they’re very cute but they’re there in these bags and it's pretty incredible.


I've had the experience a couple times with like putting these bags out in the fall and then you collect the in the spring and there’s like a thousand baby scallops in there  – it's like kind of out of nowhere.  So we collect those bags in the spring.  I was not a part of that process this year at Vertical Bay but hopefully will be next year.  And we put those into what are called pearl nets, which are sort of pyramid shaped nets that stack on top of one another.  And we let those grow for a couple months and we keep cleaning those nets and thinning the scallops for about a year and then after a year we’ll pull all of the scallops out of the pearl nets and actually drill a hole in they – they’ve got a little notch on the back of their shell, and we’ll drill a hole in that and ear hang them.  So we have these lines that have little plastic barbs that kind of look like a fish hook, and you slide that through the hole and then the fish hook, the little barb part prevents the scallop from falling off.  And we'll grow them on those lines for another year before we harvest them.  


Q:        [12:22] So is that three years total?


A:        [12:24] It's about two and a half.  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty cool.


Q:        [12:29] Yeah, so you said that's different than growing them in nets I think?


A:        [12:33] Yeah, so I don't know.  I mean the cool thing about the scallop industry in Maine and in the US is that it’s really new here.  We're just sort of figuring it out.  They've kind of got it dialed in Japan.  And so there's been a lot of information exchange which has been really cool to sort of see from afar.  At some point I'd love to go to Japan and actually see it in person.  So mostly what I've seen done on research farms, which are very different from commercial farms is folks grow scallops in what are called lantern nets.  So those are like round nets that sort of look like scallop apartment buildings.  And there's – there’s stacks of 10 and they sort of sit right on top of one another.  The nice thing about lantern nets is that there's not as much work on the front end but they’re a lot harder to clean, they get really heavy.  The scallops get really biofouled.  And so what we're seeing with the ear hanging is a lot easier to clean the scallops, it’s a lot easier to harvest them.  So if you're willing to do that work on the front end and also you have the infrastructure because you need the drill and you need the special lines with the barbs and all that stuff.  It actually ends up being more efficient on the tail end of the process.  Yeah.  


Q:        [13:52] Can you tell me a little bit about your work at Hurricane Island and what that looked like?


A:        [13:56] Yeah.  I was a research assistant and then a research technician at Hurricane, which are basically the same thing.  I was just helping out with a lot of the research that happened there.  We did some scallop dive surveys where we were looking at places that had been closed for dragging – with the natural dragging process where there’s closures every three years in places.  And then we did like a larval study of setting spat bags and counting all the spat in there to understand the larval supply in the state.  And then I actually – my second year there wrote a grant to do some stable isotope research because my background in academics is in stable isotope geochemistry and so I wanted to look and see if there was a geochemical difference between wild and farmed scallops.  And so I wrote this – I helped write this grant.  We got the grant and then we were doing this research and looking at the difference and hopefully that'll get published sometime, but with other jobs going on this stuff just starts to slow down.  But we do have some really cool data and it'll be interesting to hopefully get that out into the world at some point.


Q:        [15:11] Yeah, I'm curious, can you talk about how like that experience sort of brought you into this one or like how feel skills from that translate? 


A:        [15:18] Yeah, I think that one thing that's really true of a lot of different sectors of life is like – especially in research, it’s really easy to get disconnected from the thing that you’re researching, and especially in aquaculture where – and fisheries in general where there's sort of like a distrust of scientists because of regulations and all of that stuff.  There's a there's a disconnect that has the potential to form between scientists and growers.  And I – one of my favorite parts of this research has always been actually being on the farm and doing the thing, and tying the knots and getting muddy and so I wanted to – I both love doing that and I also wanted to be really intentional with choosing to work on a commercial farm before deciding to go into research full time, or in addition to going into research full time.  


So I'm using this as an experience to remain grounded and I'm also finding that I really love it.  I am so excited to go to work on Monday morning – it's just it's such a wonderful thing.  I don't know.  I love being on the water and doing a task and problem solving and all the things.  And it feels like I’m kind of in the right place at the right time with the scallop farming movement that's happening where people are starting to actually figure out how to do this thing and I’m right there doing it too.  So it's pretty cool.


Q:        [17:02] Great.  Yeah.  And then just a few like questions for our – like do you own any licenses or hold any licenses.


A:        [17:09] I don't hold any licenses.


Q:        [17:11] And do you have any experience beyond directly fishing or harvesting.  I'm going to list a few and you just let me know if you have experience in these areas.  In bookkeeping, bait or gear preparation.  


A:        [17:22] In gear preparation, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean a lot of – so we have to make all of our own spat lines, which is a big effort in the fall and also we have to put together those pearl nets that we were talking about and we also have to actually make the dropper lines that are ear hung, so I’ve done all of that.  A lot of time in barns.


Q:        [17:44] And what about  – and again you've mentioned this some, but like any experience you haven't touched on in research and development, in the hatcheries?  Maybe even anything like that?


A:        [17:53] I haven't ever worked in a hatchery.  I don't know if this counts, but I helped on Hurricane Island that we did some aquaculture workshops, so getting people like just out on the water and seeing what aquaculture was about.  So I helped out with that.  There was also some education with school kids out on Hurricane Island, which was cool to be a part of.


Q:        [18:13] Yeah.  Can you talk a little bit more about those experiences?


A:        [18:16] Yeah.  I was I was not the lead on either of those things.  Madison Maier was leading the aquaculture workshops out on Hurricane Island and she’s really a powerhouse and has been doing this for a while.   So she had this idea to bring members of the community in – both who have done aquaculture before and maybe who don’t have as much experience, just to come out and see our experimental sea farm, which is kind of a bite size of like a commercial aquaculture operation.  We’ve got some oysters, a line of mussels, mostly scallops and then kelp from time to time.  


And so it's a cool way to like – in a day you can see a lot of different strategies for  doing these things and so she would bring out speakers and people see our farm and do these workshops and maybe learn how to tie knots and maybe learn how to build spat bags.  And so I would help with some of those lessons and taking people out on the boats.  And then Hurricane also does educational programs through the summer and half of that is school programs.  So schools pay and then they bring a class of kids out.  And then we also – and both of those are mostly angled at middle school and high school kids.  And it's so fun to see how kids interact with the water.  Like showing a kid a whole scallop for the first time when they’ve only seen the meat in the grocery store.  And having it clap at them and sneeze in their faces always is   it's always – it's a rush, and that's who I've told that scallops are divas before and they always get a kick out of that which is fun. 


Q:        [19:53] Awesome.  Yeah, thank you.  And do you have any experience in post harvest processing, marketing, trade?


A:        [20:00] Well at Vertical Bay, there's only three of us who work full time so we all get to do everything.  Just today I shipped a bunch of scallops off to New York, so that’s part of it and then at the kelp farm that I worked at we did a little bit of that but that was really just dabbling with everything.  Nothing on a large scale.  


Q:        [20:22] And what about anything with like food prep, consumer interface, anything like that?


A:        [20:26] Not really.  


Q:        [20:27] And then anything beyond what you mentioned already but like advocacy, education, community based organization?


A:        [20:34] Not with aquaculture.  Yeah.


Q:        [20:38] Great.  And you already touched that this is like kind of a hard question to answer.


A:        [20:41] Yeah.


Q:        [20:42] But like if you could somehow create like your average day, like what are all of the things you might be doing or might be expected to do?


A:        [20:51] Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I guess I'll just walk you through what we normally do.  So we get down to the boat at about 4:50 and we leave Belfast Harbor – and usually there's things to do on the boat on the way out.  Our farm site is off of Cape Rosier by Pond Island.  And from the surface, it just looks like a couple of buoys, you wouldn’t guess all the scallops that are underneath and so we head over there and grapple the long line and pull it up.  And on any given day we'll be working with the smallest scallops, the spat.  Tomorrow will be putting spat into pearl nets and dropping those onto the farm, or we'll be harvesting so we'll be pulling the adult scallops on the dropper lines off of the farm and grading those and then cleaning them, pressure washing them and shucking them – and then shucking them as we come back into the harbor.  Yeah, that's part of what makes it so fun is every day is different.  And so we work 12 hours, and some days we work five.  And you kind of never know, so I always pack a big lunch just in case.  


Yeah, I don't know if that answers your question.


Q:        [22:04] Absolutely it does.  And I'm curious how you feel – do you feel like your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing or aquaculture sector in any way?


A:        [22:13] Yeah, I mean it is interesting to have come in from the research side of things
because I think that there is a little bit of mistrust with researchers.  I did – one of my proudest moments last summer when I was working as a research tech at Hurricane Island was I went and I helped out with Marsden Brewer, who's another scallop farmer off of Stonington.  And we were trying to really get the work done as fast as possible.  And it was like measuring weights of things so it wasn't like the hardest core science ever.  And but we were just moving scallops around and he looks at me at one point and he goes, you're a better farmer than you are a researcher.  I was like, yes, this is the highest compliment from someone like Marsden.  


But it is also really interesting being a woman in aquaculture.  And I think one thing that's different about aquaculture than fisheries is because it's a new industry, there isn't necessarily that historical male dominated side of things or that idea that maybe women don't belong there quite as much.  And I think that was one thing that was really cool about kelp farming is kelp farming is women are taking over.  It's amazing.  I mean the kelp farm that I worked at it was mostly women working there and that was such a fun environment to be a part of.  


On the scallop farm one thing that I'm experiencing is everybody thinks that I'm Andrew's wife.  They come up to introduce themselves and they say, oh, you must be the wife your son is so cute.  Like, no, I actually just work here.  So that's been an interesting, it's just like a funny thing that we laugh about.  But yeah, nobody really expects me to be on the farm.  We come into the dock usually around 2:00 pm, which is like height of ice cream cone time in Belfast so everybody’s down on the water with their ice cream cone.  I get a lot of like, oh, we didn't expect a woman to come off of that boat.  Or like, oh, you actually work there?  So I definitely get those comments.


Q:        [24:17] Great.  And how does your work on the water interacted with any family or caregiver responsibilities you might have if you have any? 


A:        [24:24] I don't at this point.  Thankfully, my grandparents are getting to the point where that's going to be a concern soon – so we'll see how that shapes.  My grandmother actually came out on the farm last week and helped do some ear hanging.  So that was funny.  She's just standing there putting the scallops on the line.  So no, not at this point.


Q:        [24:46] What was that like to have your grandma out with you?  


A:        [24:48] It was really fun.  She's a potter.  She actually made that mug that you're drinking out of.  And she spent some time in Japan learning Japanese pottery techniques.  And in Japan, when they're doing this ear hanging, it's like a big community effort.  And so Andrew was saying that it's a lot of like, grandmothers who come and help with the ear hanging.


And so my grandmother was – she was very excited to know that she was connected to that all the way on the other side of the earth, but yeah, she's always learning and it's cool to see how excited she's been about aquaculture.  She didn't know anything about it before I started.  And now she's all about it.  


Q:        [25:32] That's awesome.  I'm going to sort of transition into questions about environmental change.  Can you tell me just any changes in the marine environment that you've noticed in your time researching and working on the water?


A:        [25:43] Yeah, I mean, that's an interesting question because I've worked on the water for a couple of years, but it's been mostly in different locations around the state.  And so it's hard for me to say like, necessarily what's new in the last couple of years versus what's just a different environment.  We had those big storms this winter and I was working at an oyster farm at that point.  And the other folks who were working at the oyster farm were out of town the day that the first big storm hit.  And I got this frantic call from one of the lobstermen who was like, your gear’s all over the place, it’s not anchored at all.  And so I went down and I like, I got in a little skiff and sort of re-anchored everything.  


But yeah, I mean, it was, you know, it's tough to – like one of these storms could take out a year's worth of product for someone if you’re not careful.  And it's hard to know how to be careful with these irregular weather patterns is the other side of things. Yeah, I mean, I feel like there's more sea squirts.  Like that's one thing that I've noticed.  The kelp farm I was there for a number of years and so I got to sort of see some of that change and one thing that was interesting about that is that like some years I noticed like the kelp snails.  Some years like the kelp snails would come in really soon and like early in the season and some years they’d hold off and it was, you couldn't really predict it, which was sort of a funny thing about that.  But I don't know, there was always different amounts of kelp snails.


Q:        [27:27] Yeah.  And I'm curious like with the storms, like what effects did you see from that?  Were you able to get like get everything sunk and it was fine or did you have like a big effect from that?  


A:        [27:37] So that oyster farm that I was working at is the Bremen Lobster Pound.  And so it's got like a structure to it.  It's actually inside the bounds of one of those impoundments and there were definite impacts from that storm on that.  Some of the walls, excuse me, came down and we lost some gear.  And definitely some of the docks were impacted.  I mean that the water came up so high it was incredible to see some of the electric blue in the like upweller system that they have there, so yeah, I mean there were definite impacts, but less so than some of the other places. You know, I grew up on the on the Damariscotta peninsula and some of what was happening in Pemaquid and Round Pond was really heartbreaking to see all those old fishing shacks just like disappear into the sea.  It's pretty intense.


Q:        [28:36] And what about Vertical Bay?  Were they affected by the storm?  Did they have any issues?  


A:        [28:40] I was not at Vertical Bay at the time, I mean luckily, you know, one of the things that's different about scallop aquaculture than oyster aquacultures is the gear isn’t floating ever, it’s pretty well sunk.  And so I haven't actually talked to them about that particular storm to see if they were impacted.  But I would imagine that that gear is a little bit hardier than oyster gear when it comes to those types of storms but plenty of other things will come and mess up our lines.  I mean, currents are really tough on the line.  Sometimes they sway and sort of tangled together.  And we just hope that – it doesn't stay that way for too long.


Q:        [29:17] Are there any like environmental changes that people you work for who have like been there longer are really noticing with the scallops?


A:        [29:23] I think biofouling is changing.  That's one thing that's always going to be an issue in aquaculture is like if you’re setting gear for so long plenty of other things will grow on it.  Those invasive sea squirts are really a problem.  They make the gear really heavy and hard to work with and we're seeing a lot of those, particularly on like our long lines that don't necessarily get cleaned as often as some of the nets. They just cling on and make it really heavy.  And that's not so good for the gear because it can drag and those lines can tangle and all that stuff.  


Yeah, I mean, it'll be interesting.  I think one of the things that's cool about aquaculture as opposed to wild fisheries is that you’re intentionally choosing to grow a species in an area.  Right?  Like I would never choose to grow oysters at our Vertical Bay site because it's, you know, it's out in the bay, the water's a little colder.  Like that's not the environment that oysters like and vice versa.  I would never grow scallops in the Bremen Lobster Pound.  And so we're getting to kind of make some of these choices to adapt to some of the changes that we’re seeing and also to the given environments that we have.  And I think that that's one really great thing about aquaculture moving forward is that we can kind say OK here’s what we got what are we going to do with that?


Q:        [30:47] Yeah.  Can you talk a little bit about like other adaptations you might be making, maybe in response to the biofouling or just other things you all are seeing?


A:        [30:55] Well, the ear hanging is kind of a response to biofouling.  It's a lot easier to clean the ear hung scallops than the scallops in nets and so the sooner we can get them on those lines, the better, the faster they'll grow and the easier they’ll be to deal with.  


Some of the other changes we’re making – yeah, I mean, it's interesting to think about that because the scallop industry, the scallop farming industry in particular is so new in Maine that I feel like we’re adapting in real time as these things are happening.  And also like figuring out how to do it in the first place and so it's parsing those things out is interesting to try and do.  But yeah, definitely the ear hanging is a response.  I mean, I remember working at Hurricane and at the Darling Marine Center trying to haul a lantern net onto a boat and it takes like three people to bring it up over the side.  I mean, some of those things weigh 200 pounds and the ear hung lines are definitely a lot easier to deal with.


Q:        [32:00] Yeah, and with like, with thinking about like designing it towards adaptation or like designing it towards the future, what other things are you guys doing or do you think you’ll do as you look towards the future?


A:        [32:12] Yeah, I mean, one thing that's really interesting to me and a this is like my scientist brain always kind of working in the background is that the idea of polyculture.  So like growing multiple species together, both for like any time you can have more species in an area is good.  Monoculture has been really tough for some of the agriculture that we’ve seen and so trying to avoid some of those same downfalls in the ocean is a goal of mine for sure.  But you can also use polyculture to like have species work together and so you know one idea that's been tossed around is having urchins be in the nets with the scallops because they wont eat the scallops but they’ll eat some of that biofouling.  


And you know, there's other things like that that have been tossed around.  I think as much as we can, like one of one of my favorite fun facts is that lumpfish are the second most farmed fish in Norway.  Have you ever seen a lumpfish?  They’re adorable, and it's because they eat the sea lice in the salmon pens and you can also harvest them and use their roe as a sturgeon caviar substitute.  And so there's a lot of ways to be dynamic about these problems and having solutions but also if we were to grow urchins in the nets, like we could also sell the urchin roe and that’s another revenue source.  And so there's – I think the more we can be thinking about those types of solutions the better I think.


Q:        [33:50] And what do you think makes it possible to make those kind of changes and think about those solutions?


A:        [33:55] Yeah, I mean it's being on a commercial farm is really interesting because there's  that profit incentive, right?  I mean Vertical Bay is still not making money at this point because all of the gear is so expensive and we’re trying to create a market for farmed scallops because people don’t even know that that’s a thing.  So there's a lot of those hurdles to jump as a commercial farmer.  And so I think that that's where the research partnership comes in and is really important because in research there’s grants and scientists don’t need to harvest a certain amount of scallops a day to make a living.  And so that's where I think good research and good farming and good policy can all sort of inform each other and why relationship building is so important within all of this because you need people to be those bridges.  Yeah.


Q:        [34:52] Yeah, absolutely.  And I'm curious like are there other things you think that Vertical Bay or just like farmers in general are really going to draw on as they look towards the future?  Maybe those are like specific trainings, organizations anything like that?


A:        [35:07] Well, the University of Maine has been a really great asset and I think has done a really good job of like working with farmers.  I know Struan Coleman who's also works at Vertical Bay was a masters student at the University of Maine and originally got started because he had some experimental gear on the Vertical Bay farm site and he was using it as a site for his thesis.  And so those sort of relationship building and bridges that are being drawn.  Can you say the question again?  I lost the thread.


Q:        [35:42] Just thinking about like adaptation and the ability to make it I'm curious this is the longer list.  Are there any resources, relationships, knowledge, training or organizations that you think are going to be really important to draw or that you already have and will into the future.  


A:        [36:02] Well, Vertical Bay got their start with grant money.  They got their first long line with grant money and I think that having those resources and knowing how to access those resources also is really important because there’s plenty of people who are trying to do this work you don’t necessarily know that those resources are available.  And a lot of that is happening by word of mouth.  I know that Sea Grant is doing a great job with partnering with farmers and also working with some of those grants and making connections that way.  I don't know if this is necessarily answer your question.


Q:        [36:43] Yeah, no, that was great, and then sort of a transition – what is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future of Maine’s fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [36:52] That's a tough question.  I mean, there's so much that's changing here in the Gulf of Maine, right?  I mean, we’re kind of a canary.  Waters are warming so fast and it's hard.  You know, I mentioned earlier like one of the great things about aquaculture is that we get to choose what to grow and where to grow it but also, are we going to be able to keep up with that warming and you know with ocean acidification like some of these bivalves can’t put on shell.  And so hoping that this is going to continue to be an option in the future, but there's only so much we can do at the end of the day if the oceans are changing as rapidly as they are currently.  And I think that that's another reason why I really love aquacultures is because there's so much mitigation that’s happening within it.  Bivalves they’re cleaning the water and the kelp is pulling some of that carbon out in local environments.  So there's a lot of good work that's being done, but also in the back of my mind I'm always sort of thinking about those charts where the water just exponentially keeps warming and it's scary and it's hard to know at this point like if we're doing enough and how we can do more.


Q:        [38:17] Yeah, and if you could like tell a policy maker or someone in charge, like what do you think is the big priority looking towards the future with those concerns in mind?


A:        [38:26] I mean apart from our world is a system, right?  All these things are intertwined and our oceans are warming because of some of these huge companies that are putting off so much carbon into the atmosphere and then the ocean acts as this big sink and it just pulls all of that carbon in.  And so I think just like focusing on some of those things, carbon – why can't I think of the word?  Not offsets, but like carbon emissions into the atmosphere – there it is.  Trying to, trying to limit that as much as possible, but also trying to figure out how to reverse what we’ve already done. It’s both reactive policy but also proactive policy in terms of getting folks to jump on the solution and I think that that’s like – that's one thing that's always getting me down in the science world is like there’s so much stuff telling us that we can’t do it and that it’s past return.  And I don't think that's true.  I don't want to think that's true.  And so I think that there needs to be a lot of focus on that proactive policy and thinking ahead and thinking how to sort of turn back on what we have already done.


Q:        [39:54] Yeah, absolutely.  And have you participated in any like climate resilience training, adaptation training, anything like that?


A:        [40:03] No official trainings, no.


Q:        [40:06] And what do you think might be useful for people as like with these concerns in mind to like build resilience?


A:        [40:12] In coastal economies specifically, I mean, I think the, you know, some of the like outreach that I’ve been a part of like the aquaculture workshops and just getting folks engaged and knowing that this is happening – not only to be a part of the growing side, but also to be a part of the eating side, right?  Like this is a really sustainable form of protein that we’ve figured out how to grow and so using scallops or oysters or mussels to replace, you know, red meat or some of those other things that we know are causing emissions is huge.  You don't have to go out and buy a long line to be a part of this, right?  Like you can just change what you’re eating.  But I think that people don't necessarily know that that's an option and there's a lot of sort of stigma around seafood also, like lobsters are so expensive and so are scallops.  I mean, but the more we figure out how to do this and the more people are doing it, the more affordable it’s going to be and the more people are going engage with eating it.


So, I think there's just, there's a lot to be done with like education and outreach through media and all of that stuff, which I think is slowly building.  Everybody’s really excited about – everybody who I talk to who kind of knows what I’m doing is so excited about scallop farming and it’s awesome.  And I'm also really excited about scallop farming and I think that that comes through when I tell these stories and so I hope that I can keep telling these stories and keep letting people know that this is happening.


Q:        [41:59] Yeah, absolutely.  And is there anything maybe like non-environmental that's really impacting your work that you want to tell us about?


A:        [42:06] Non-environmental that's impacting my work.  


Q:        [42:11] And that can be like maybe even like positive change, like what you were just saying about like getting people really excited about protein or just protein from the sea.  Just stuff like that.


A:        [42:19] Yeah, yeah I’m trying to think.  I mean – it's been, I've always grown up in communities and I think that the amazing thing about communities is that is if you can get a group of people behind something then that can actually cause real change.  And so being part of a small town and having my mom have a Facebook presence, like all these things like are letting people into this world of aquaculture through me and my friends and my co-workers and everybody who’s doing this.  And so I think I'm just really grateful to have a community in this group of folks who I grew up, but also in Maine is one big small town, kind of.  If anywhere is going to get the word out about aquaculture it’s going to be Maine. 


So I think that that's made me really excited about living here and makes me excited about continuing to do this work here and engage with communities.  It's always really fun.  I mentioned my grandmother came out on the boat to do that ear hanging.  We have these days where we invite people to come and help us and we pay them and they get to spend a day on the boat with us doing ear hanging and it makes my heart swell to see like everybody who shows up and just like we're playing music and playing games and everybody’s just pinning scallops onto a line.  It's just this like amazing group of people always.


Q:        [44:04] Yeah, and sort of like spitballing with that energy, what is your really hopeful vision for the future of Maine’s fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [44:14] You know, I think honestly my biggest hope like putting aside numbers and those sort of projections is just generally communication and trust.  I think that one thing that is tricky about fisheries is that there's a lot of mistrust of scientist and policy makers around regulations and I think that's fair.  Honestly, like there's been a lot of regulations put on particularly the lobster industry to try and keep it sustainable and I think that we've actually done a really good job of doing that.  But at the same time, there hasn't been enough relationship building to go alongside that and build that trust and I think that fishermen also are a little – in my experience – a little skeptical of aquaculture.


A lot of folks are really excited about it, but occasionally you bump up against folks who are a little bit skeptical and so just like if we can keep relationships built and smooth between fishermen and farmers and scientists and policy makers, I think we can do a lot and there's already been really interesting efforts in the kelp farming world to have like this partner farming model where Atlantic sea farms is getting lobstermen in particular to grow kelp over the winter, which is their off season.  And they sell the fishermen the seed at the beginning of the season and then they guarantee buyback of the kelp at the end of the season and so we're sort of exploring the idea of doing that in the scallop industry as well.  And so I think that there’s a lot of potential for those relationships to be built, but I think that that's going to be something that's really important moving forward.  It's just like this trust within the coast because we're all just trying to make a living and keep the ocean providing for us.


Q:        [46:24] And have you noticed any changes in women's participation, presence or status on the water since you’ve been working?


A:        [46:32] Yes and no.  I mean, my first job out on the water, I was in a group of all men and out at Hurricane I was in a group of all women and that was amazing.  And I always get really excited when I see another woman on a boat.  Yeah, I mean, it –just varies, you know, in parts of the state I think there are farms that are mostly women and there are farms that aren’t so much that way.  And again, I think that there's – in within aquaculture with it being a new industry, there's a lot of room.  There is a lot more room for women than traditionally male dominated spaces and so that that has been something that's really wonderful to see.  But it is – I think it's even with that I think that it's really difficult for non men to enter this industry because there is an expectation of physical labor and often women aren’t hired for those jobs in the first place and so they don't have that on the resume to say like, no, really, I can do this. 


And so, you know, I'm lucky to have a background in this and I feel like my coworkers really take me seriously and that’s such a gift because I definitely haven't always experienced that both on the water and off.  But it's just something that we’re going to have to continue working on and one of the really wonderful things that I'm seeing is I think women on the water really foster other women on the water.  There's a lot of like  –I see women sort of dragging each other into like an oyster farm.  Like all of a sudden there’s six women working there (inaudible) be it and teaching those skills and showing, no really, it can be done.  So that's been really wonderful to see also.                                                                                        


Q:        [48:35] Great.  Thank you.  And then is there a –


A:        [48:40] Oh, we're at the end.  Let's see.  I just think that it's – we're at a really pivotal moment here in the Gulf of Maine and I think that there's a lot of work to be done in so many of these spaces, right?  Like inclusion on the waterfront and working towards a sustainable solutions in the future and I think that they're not unlinked, right?  Like a lot of these things can go hand in hand and just working towards that and fostering women on the waterfront and trying to create a sustainable future in protein is like something that I’m really jazzed about and looking forward to sharing with folks.  Just – that’s like a thesis statement about the interview I guess. 


Q:        [49:39] Yeah.  And do you have any questions before we.  


Q:        [49:43] Yeah, I was curious if you had any observations of green crabs.


A:        [49:47] Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I think this was one thing that I actually meant to mention.
So thank you.  You know, I told that story about like going down to my grandparents cove and harvesting mussels as a kid.  One thing that I've always grown up hearing is like, there's no more mussels.  The mussels are gone.  And so that's been a really interesting thing to observe with climate change, because I think that the way that climate change looks isn't necessarily the way that people think it looks.  It's not only that the water is becoming more acidic or that it's warming, it's also that like it's encouraging these invasive species to grow here.  


So there's, you know, there's all the green crabs, there’s all the sea squirts.  Everyone's always talking about like the great white sharks are coming here, but that's because the seals have come.  So there's all these things are linked, but it doesn't necessarily – if you're not looking closely, the puzzle pieces don't necessarily fit together.  But yeah, we see green crabs on all the farms that I've been on.  They're not so much a problem with scallops that I've seen.  They will eat the babies, but the nets that we have keep them out for the most part. And we just try and keep our gear up off the ground.  Otherwise, there's an army waiting to sort of claw up and eat all of our scallops.  So – yeah.


Q:        [51:15] Great.  I will turn this off.


END OF FILE"
"19","Q:        [00:00] Great, thank you so much.  And now we are recording officially.  And I would just like to start with how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [00:06] So I'm Holly Masterson from Southwest Harbor and I'm from there.  So I grew up right in Southwest.  I was born in Ellsworth.  I grew up right on the shore in Southwest Harbor.  Literally my bedroom looks over the harbor.


        So I would wake up as a small child to clammers, and to the worm diggers, and everyone just – I mean that was my morning.  The sun shining through my window and then these guys down on the flats.  And you can't actually harvest anything in the harbor anymore.  So it seems like eons ago at this point.  But, yeah.  And about to be 44 so that was a while ago and yeah, that's where I grew up.  


        So that's sort of the basis for who I am.  And what I've been doing is that I grew up right there on the harbor and did a few things in between, but found myself working on the boat when I was 14.  Yeah.  


Q:        [00:58] Wow.


A:        [00:59] Yeah.  And my parents had a fish market.  So when I was in seventh grade, sixth grade they started that.  And my stepfather had two boats, so he would go out fishing and he'd be gone for seven days at a time.


        He'd come into the marina in Southwest, and we'd get the fish.  We'd bring them up to the fish market which was only about a half mile away.  And my great Aunt Connie would show up.  And she was sort of the skilled elder of the area.  So she would come and teach everybody how to fillet the fish, and she's been gone for a long time.


        So I have pictures of that, and it was really great to have her – those memories of her in the fish market, filleting the fish, talking about the corn hake, and how they used to drive fish back in the day, and how important that was to everybody.  You know, that was a huge source of protein for them.  


        So that's sort of what started my life into the fishing world is that I was about 12 when my mom got together with my – he's been my dad.  I've been fishing with him for 20 years but – so I was young.  


        And then I would – when I got my license I would go down to the boat for him and I'd clean up the boat.  He, you know, come in, unload the fish.  The boat would be a disaster.  I'd go down.  I'd clean up what I could.  I'd – they'd leave me a grocery list.  And then I'd come over here to Bar Harbor, and I'd go to Hannaford, and I think it was Shop and Save at that point.  


        But I'd get whatever they wanted on the boat.  I'd restock for them.  I'd just kind of spruce it up, because they were usually only in port for like a day or two and then they turn around and go back right back out and do that.


        So that was their opportunity to go play golf, and take a real shower, and relax and do a little laundry and just sort of reconnect.  And then that – I was sort of that piece of helping put the boat back out to sea.


        So I started that when I was 15 – 14, 15 of doing that.


Q:        [02:52] Wow.  And we've sort of talked about where you grew up, but where are your parents from?  You mentioned the fish market.  But (inaudible; overlapping dialogue). 


A:        [03:00] Yeah, so my mom is from here.  She's worked in boat yards her whole life.  And then when we had the fish market she obviously did that for many years.


        My father is actually from Salem, Massachusetts, my biological father.  And I have a great, great, great grandfather that is on the wall in Gloucester for being lost at sea.


        So really kind of strong heritage for me because I've now been fishing out of Gloucester.  I've been to that port.  I've gone through that breakwater.  I've been on those same banks that he was fishing on.  


        So that was a huge moment for me many years ago when I did that because, not only was I the only woman out there – I mean I'm out there.  You're literally – you're looking back.  You can see Boston in the distance.  You can – you know where Gloucester is because there's the lighthouse, and you know where that is.  


        But you're looking around.  And you literally see – there's whales breaching right next to us.  There are maybe 35, 40 boats and I knew I was the only woman out there.  


        So I had this like really weird just realization of life of, like what the hell am I doing out here.  Like is this really like what I should be doing?


        But it almost came easy to me, and I feel like that's – I'm not trying to like be egotistical about that, but it's like, I think women being on the boat in that sort of situation, like – it's not even that we have something to prove, it's just I had built up such an endurance to be on the boat, and like there was – I didn't – I wasn’t into drugs.  I wasn't into like this partying lifestyle.  I was just really focused on being there and making money.  


        And it was just such a spiritual experience for me to be doing that and being able to be like here in an interview right now, knowing that I sort of helped pave the way, because I know there are now more women out there, and I'm friends with them on Facebook.  I see their post and their Instagram like stories and stuff, and I'm just like, good for you.  Like there you go.


        Like there are women that have been out there and that's something that's been – like knowing that my dad was from the area and that I had that connection was huge.  But Dave, who is my captain and my stepfather, is actually from Atlantic City.  So he came up here when he was 11 to fish, and then my mom and him got together when I was, yeah, in junior high.


        So I kind of have the three part trifecta of all of them, which was pretty important.  My mom the boat builder.  You know, Dave, the guy from Atlantic City that was very business oriented and was very inspired by the fishing community in Atlantic City, so when he came here that's immediately what he started doing when he was 11 and 12.  And then my dad's connection to the area of Gloucester, which is so incredible and in very spiritual to be part of that.  Yeah 


Q:        [05:45] Yeah.  And what year were you born in?


A:        [05:47] So 1980.


Q:        [05:49] 1980.  Great.  And do you have any siblings? 


A:        [05:51] I do not.  Yeah.  I'm an only child, so sort of got to be an only child until my mom and Dave got together.  And then he had older daughter, so she was a senior when I was a freshman that was fun.  (laughter)  Got to have sort of a little bit of a sibling for a short period of time in my life.  But yeah.  I'm an only child.


Q:        [06:10] Great and you talked a little bit about your heritage and their relationship with fishing, but do you have anyone else in your family, the extended family who fish?


A:        [06:18] Yeah, so my boyfriend actually – we've been together for nine years – and he's a clam harvester which is really cool.  So – and he's one of the most passionate clammers you'll ever meet.  So – and he actually just did a show with David Moscow called Taste – or From Scratch, and it's on Tastemade.  And that just aired in December.  And he is just such a huge – like he's so passionate about conservation and clamming, and the fact that there's like virtually no impact to clamming.  And that clam – we always laughed over the years that like nobody cares about clams.


        Like clams are there but they're not being – you don't have to bait them.  You don't have to – I mean other than crossing people's property to get to them, there's very – like nobody – they're not as like sanctioned as a lobster or these other things that clearly are much more political and have a lot more kind of issues with them.


        So, yeah, he's a clammer, but, yeah, everyone in my family immediately – my daughter's father is a lobster man.  He actually goes to Alaska and works on a huge black cod boat out there.  So I'm – I mean I've got people all around me.  All my friends, I mean growing up.  


        But now you know it's weird because there's a less of a stern person community, and it's really hard for fishermen to find sternmen.


        And so like back in the you know 12, 15, 20 years ago everyone wanted to be on the lobster boat.  That was the thing.  Like if you could get on a boat, great.  If you get on a good boat, like you're something.  You know?  Like you're cool.  And now it's – the fishermen are really struggling to keep good crew, and I totally get that.  


        It's a hard job.  It's not paying as well as it used to.  You're the grunt worker.  You know?  It's like, shit rolls downhill is absolutely a thing.  And, you know, when you're on the boat there are some captains that really try to like be normal and be civil on the boat, but there's – it's just hard.  


        It's – I mean, I got beat up on the boat like mentally, because I'm – you know, I'm – if I'm a little bit sluggish or if I'm not keeping up.  It wasn't so much that as it was like in my head I was telling myself I'm not good enough.  And so I went through years of, you know, you're on a boat with one maybe, two other people, and you're in your head a lot.  So there's a lot of like mental kind of conditioning that happens, and that's where, I think, a lot of the endurance comes in.


        And so the worst part for me actually working on the boat was when another woman came and worked on our boat with us.  And that was really a hard situation, because you're kind of both struggling at that point mentally to be out there.  And as great as like the sun rises are, and the wildlife, and seeing everybody.  It's – it's a – you get into this kind of – it's a competitive, but also you want to be supportive.  So it's really hard.  It's interesting.  And I have a lot of friends that have done it and then they don't do it anymore.  


        So I think your question was (laughter) if there's anyone else in my immediate family or around, and definitely.  Yeah.


F:        [09:35] I was going to ask we have also a question of like see we've addressed a lot of different roles of members of your family.  Seems like almost everyone you're (inaudible; overlapping dialogue).


A:        [09:47] A lot.  (inaudible; overlapping dialogue) Yeah, a lot. 


F:        [09:48] (inaudible; overlapping dialogue) story.  And we also were – have a followup question about, do you have any family history of other folks working, you know not directly as harvesters, but in other kind of roles in the fishing sector like bookkeeping, bait, gear.


A:        [09:59] Yeah.


F:        [10:00] And you – I was just curious about great aunt Connie – 


A:        [10:02] Yeah.


F:        [10:03] – and just kind of which side of the family was she on?


A:        [10:05] So she's amazing.  Yeah.  


F:        [10:06] And sort of how did you learn this skill?  Like from her own parents, or did she work in a fish factory?


A:        [10:10] Yeah.  So my grandmother, my nana, worked at Addison Packing Company.  And I don't know if it was Stinson's when she was there.  She was there in the late – she was there in the ‘60s and the ’70s.  And so they all worked in the fish factories.  And that's one thing that we've been, really – I've been trying to find out more information about.  Because it sounds like in the late ‘70s, when that fish factory at man – at Dysart's down there.  When that actually closed their doors it just closed.  


        And those people – like,  you know.  They use to have a bell.  I don't know if you've heard these stories, but there was the bell in town in Southwest Harbor, and it would ring a certain number of chimes depending on if it was packers, or if it was the unloaders, or depending on what your role was at the fish factory.  So that bell would go off and that would call to the docks who needed to be there.


        So my grandmother was part of that.  Aunt Connie was part of that.  And I believe her husband Kelsey was, and I wish I knew more of anyone there.  But those were always the people that stuck out to me in my childhood as being like the fish people.  And they were the women, which is my aunt Connie and my grandmother.  Those were the ones living – that worked that.  And Connie was just well known in our community back then as just being this like fish filleter.  (laughter)


        You know?  And she was good at it.  And very particular.  Very particular.  Every bone was – they had this like handling machine that was just like a light, and they would put the fillets on it, and she would make sure the worms, the bones – anything she could get out was like – it was a perfect fillet when she was done with it.  


        And now you just don't have that skill.  People don't do that anymore.  You go the grocery store.  You go somewhere else.  You don't get fresh fish like that off the boat anymore.    But to them that was how they grew up.  And then they'd skin it just right so they could fillet it, and then have it in the drying racks, and that was a huge thing.


        I mean, I remember walking into my grandmother's apartment, because she lived – as I got – when I was young, she lived over in Southwest Harbor in this little apartment.  And you walk in, and you could tell whenever the fish was there.  It just smelled.  It made me want to gag.  I was like that is the grossest thing I've ever smelled.  But they loved it.  And then when we had the fish market that was a huge product.  Like people would call from all over to get that.  And we'd have these drying racks, and it was just – didn't seem that appetizing, but it was really popular.


        So yeah, Connie was – Connie was great.  And then my grandmother too.  But by the time I got old enough, the canary obviously was closed and she was retired at that point.


Q:        [12:56] Can you tell me a little more about the fish market?


A:        [12:59] Yeah.  So it was in Manset and it was called Fan Dave’s.  And it was converted old sea captains house, actually Captain Clark.  And the house is still there but it's in desperate need of repairs now.  Small little fish market, we had everything that the boats caught.  We had had haddock.  Pollock.  All the souls.  Flounders.  Halibut when we could get it.  We'd actually purchase salmon from one of the farms over off Indian Point.  We had crab meat, we had clams, muscles.  We had everything that we could get.  Lobsters.  


        And actually having the fish market is what got Dave back to getting his lobster license, because that – in 1996 is when the fisheries licensing changed.  So it was pretty much wide open until ’96, and then ’96 is when they started implementing trap reduction and licensing, and that's when all those rules kind of came into play.  


        So that's when he went back and got his lobster license.  He had had it when he was a kid but he had turned into a dragger, so he was shrimping, scalloping, whiting fishing, herring fishing.  Folks who just scalloping obviously.  


        And then got back into lobstering when we had the market, which is huge, because now, I mean, that's what – when I went – started fishing with him is when he was just couldn't keep a crew.  You know?  He'd have everybody would work out for a few months, and then they'd make enough money.  They'd get distracted.  They wouldn't show up.  Whatever.  It wasn't working out.  


        So I helped him one fall pick up all his traps, and I was miserable.  It was like I hate this.  It's cold.  And you know this was when – October.  


        So this was October of, oh, geez, 2003 2004.  And it was freezing.  I mean, it was October.  Now our Octobers are 70 degrees, which is really – this year we looked back on that as like wow, do you remember what 20 years look like, because that was when I got my job, was because his crew had slipped on the ice and fallen.  We’ve never saw ice in October.  I don't know if we ever will.  


        I mean, it was beautiful in October.  There was no – I mean people were getting suntanned still and it was like beautiful.  But that was 20 years ago, what we were faced with.  And it was freezing cold.  And I went fishing with him and said I'll never do that again.  But then when I got up to the dock he's like well do you want know how much you made today.  And I'm just like freezing.  I'm in my truck trying to warm up, and he's like, you made like $275.  And I was like, what?  


        And I mean, to me I was young.  I didn't have any money.  I mean, to make 200-plus dollars for – really it wasn't that long of a day either.  I mean it was still light out when we got in.  So it wasn't that long.  But I was just like, oh my gosh that's a lot of money.  That's how much my car payment  is.  Like I could do a lot with us.  So that got me hooked almost immediately.  So good old money.  (laughter)


Q:        [16:02] Yeah and then you mentioned your boyfriend.  Do you have any children?


A:        [16:06] I do. I have a daughter who is 14 and a half.  She's a freshman.  So she's come out.


        I actually fished with her when I was pregnant until January.  And I was about six months pregnant.  And we were heading out scalloping.  And, oh my gosh, this was – this is actually a funny story.


        So, you know, I was here.  I was ready to go.  Like, I knew I was pregnant.  I was very pregnant.  But I definitely was still really into fishing every day.


        I mean, you build up that adrenaline to get up every morning and just go on the boat.  What else do you do if you're not doing that?  I've been doing that for so long, like I didn't have any – I didn’t have a life.  I mean, that was what I did.


        So, I called Dave and was just like, ""OK.  What time does the boat leaving in the morning.  He’s like, I don't know if we're going go.  It's going to be windy.  So, I'm like, OK.  Well, just call me in the morning and let me know.  I need like 45 minutes notice to like get there on time and everything.


        So, he texted me in the morning, he's like, Yeah, we're not going to go.  He's like, I'll call you later this morning.  So, I'm like, OK, cool.  I'm going back to bed.  I wake up, I go down to the dock, boat’s gone.


        So like, what?  What happened?  Where's the boat?  And he's like, We went fishing.  He's like, Holly, you are almost six months pregnant.  You are staying home.  Like, I'm making the call.  You're done.


        And it was winter.  It was January.  I was very pregnant and he was just like, Nope.  We're making the call for you.  You're not going do this until you actually give birth.  Like, You're not having a baby out here and you need to take care of yourself.


        So, Eden has been on the boat, yeah, since the beginning.  And then I went back fishing as soon as the doctor gave me clearance.  I think I was like two-and-a-half weeks after I gave birth, I went back fishing just part time.  But I couldn't be kept away.  I needed the money and I needed sanity.  


        I found very quickly that, I think, as a young mother – I was a single mother too.  So, her father and I were friends, but he was working on a boat in Portland at the time.  So, he came back when she was a couple months old at that point.


        So, in those first few months of having her, I didn't know what I was doing.  And I actually thanked everybody to be on that boat, because it gave me some sanity.  It was only like, we'd only go out for about six hours.  So, it gave me some time to process like, oh my God, I have a small human at home.  And my mom was thrilled to be able to be like, ""Grammy.”  Like, oh my gosh, I'll take the baby.  And, you know, you go do what you need to do.


        And so, I did that for the first three or four years that she was in her early years.  And it was really great.  And she'd come out with us.  Like she'd get rejected sometimes for daycare.  If she had a fever or anything like that, we'd bring her shrimping.  


        I mean, she's been right out here shrimping when she was two-and-a-half-years old, which is crazy.  Because she's not a huge fan of fishing right at the moment, because she doesn't like the smell of the bait.  But she loves being on the boat.  And she can – I mean, I've got pictures of her holding huge lobsters like nothing.  


        I mean, it's just – it's so natural for her to be out there.  But she doesn't love it.  (laughter)  It's not – I don't see her doing that forever.  (laughter)


Q:        [19:12] Would you want her to?  Would you like her to go on fishing?


A:        [19:14] There's a – I want her to be connected to it.  Do I want her to be out every day going through the grind, and the rules, and the regulations, and the cost and the BS that goes with it?  Not so much.


        I think I'm definitely seeing the industry for kind of what it is.  And as great as it was from my years of being there, I don't necessarily think that that's going to be a great career choice for young people.


        I mean, yes, definitely some people are just so driven.  They get up every day like I was.  You get up every day.  You don't know anything different.  You're going on the boat.  You know where your bait is.  This, that – it's so routine.


        I mean, the things that we do every day, we laugh about it.  It's like, I just did that 700 times.  I mean, there are things that are just very routine about it.  And there's a huge aspect of the mental physical ability that when you're working through like a mental problem, if you can be physically active while you're trying to figure it out.


        And so I think for me, as I've stepped away from the boat now, I've really looked back on that time with a lot of gratitude of, wow, I was going through some really deep things.  And I do think my time on the boat actually helped me figure out some really good choices.


        And so that's something that is not really part of the fishing world, though.  That's like the more personal side of it.  And as far as the industry is concerned, though, things are changing huge.  And I don't know what it's going to look like.


        It's always been here, though.  I mean, that's one thing that we've always talked about.  It's one of the most sustainable fisheries.  It's been around for 100 years.  And I don't necessarily think it's going away.  It's just changing.  Technology is going to change everything in the next 20 years.  And that's something that I think that all – anyone that's interested in it, there's an avenue somewhere.


        She came with me last year, two years ago.  We met with a couple of ropeless fishing guys, and they had their buoys.  We went down the shore here a little ways and actually tested some stuff and she came with me, because I wanted her just to be aware that things are changing.  But at 12, 13, that kind of went right over her head.  She's – I want her to be more involved than she really wants to be.  (laughter)  But there's a lot of – 


        I mean, when you're talking about the bookkeepers and all the different people that are involved, it's just the web.  I mean, it spreads.


        And so I do think things are changing on the island as far as – it's been – like, Southwest Harbor has been a fishing community since the beginning.  I mean, we had that cannery.  It was one of the first canneries on the coast.  But things are changing.  And if those things go away, then the connections are getting lost and the skills.


        Like, my great aunt Connie, I mean, I don't know anyone that really fillets fish like that.  Other than they’re chefs, but they're not in a fish market situation or providing.  


Q:        [22:09] Yeah, I think that's a good segue.  Can you describe just the roles you've had in the – fishing?


A:        [22:14] Yeah.  So started off at the fish market when I was young.  And actually, prior to that, my uncle Gary just clammed for fun.  So we'd always take his little whaler out to one of the islands and go find hen clams or dig up clams with him.  


        And then I worked at the fish market.  And then stayed on helping Dave with the cleaning of the boat and getting the boat ready.  And I mean, it was a disaster.  (laughter)  You know, it’s like three or four sweaty men fishing.  It's in rough shape.  So I did what I could.


        And then after that era of my life, I – I mean, I moved away.  I went to New York City.  I kind of did my own thing for a few years.  But what got me back was when his crew had slipped on the ice in October and he needed someone to go pick up traps with him.  And I was like, I can do that, whatever.  


        So I did that.  But then I never left.  And that was – that was the beginning of my last 20 years of my life of being on the boat.  But I've done a lot of things in the last 20 years.  


        As far as fishing, I mean, I go down to Portland and I pick up bait.  I do bait runs.  I try to attend as many meetings as I could.  I've got my lobster license, which took forever to – I was on the list for 13 years.  


        So I was extremely vocal in that era of my life trying to talk to Augusta, and meeting the commissioner and meeting representatives.  I mean, why are you keeping us out?  Because I honestly think that if I had got my license back when I first wanted it, I would have my own boat and I would be out there on my own.  But it just took too long.


        So I ended up getting my real estate license.  I now have this mini golf business.  I've now like – you've made me choose other paths because I couldn't be my own boss.  And that's what I really wanted to be.


        And, oh, geez, what else have I done?  I've helped a lot of girls.  Like young girls get their apprentice, taking them out on the boat with us, sign papers.  Just trying to inspire them, however, just to try it.  You might not love it.


        I've taken girls out.  We get out three or four miles, and they're like, so when do we go back?  (laughter)  And I'm like, we haven't even got started yet.  So there’s – I like to show them that. And there's other women that I know on the island that have done that too, which is really great.


        So Lindsay McDaniels, I don't know if she's on your list or not, but she's incredible.  And she has her own boat.  And she also takes out the young teenage girls to show them.  They all want to try it.  OK, come try it.  (laughter)  And I guess that's it.


        I mean, I've done a lot of publications and stuff, like the Pretty Rugged book.  I don’t if you've seen that.  But that is something that Ali Farrell out of Rockland produced.  And there's, I believe, 26 women in that book, which is really great.  And that was a fun project to be part of.  


        And the Southwest Harbor Public Library and the Southwest Harbor Historical Society has reached out.  And we've tried to do as many kind of partnerships – just trying to leave the legacy of what I've contributed and just trying to get people to know that it does exist for young girls.


Q:        [25:33] Yeah, you've mentioned shrimping and scalloping.  What is your interaction with those guys?


A:        [25:36] So shrimping's been shut down for 10 years.  So that was great.  I love that fishery.  That was all right out here, too, for the most part.  


        That I would sell – so it was the same thing.  We'd get the product and we'd always go through this marketing issue of, like, OK, if we put it on the truck, if we sell it to a dock, do we sell it locally?  Do we sell it to restaurants?  I mean, we kind of – on the boat, that's the conversation that happens daily all the time.  And it's always about producing a high-quality product and getting it back to the people.


        And so, right from the beginning, that was my main conversation with Dave when I first started with him is that we're here to feed the people.  So a good product.  Like, we're not going to give them several day-old fish.  We're not going to give them bones.  We're not going to give them dead lobsters.  We're going to produce a high quality product.  And we get a better price for that.  Grade A is obviously a lot better than anything else.


        So the shrimping – that's, I think, we shrimped before we scalloped.  There was one winter where we did all three, like, insane.  So we'd go lobstering one day, go haul our traps, come back, convert the boat.  We had everything right on the dock.  We just, like – it took us, like, 45 minutes to convert from one fishery to the next, because it was, like, dual purpose boat.  


        And I think now I'm looking back on it, it's like, did he do that just so we could say that years from now that we actually did that?  Because it was insane.  I mean, there was – and this was pre-Eden.  


        So I mean, this was a part of my life where I did nothing but be on the boat.  I mean, if I got home to sleep, I was doing good.  


        So yeah, we'd convert the boat.  We'd go out lobstering.  We'd come in.  We'd sell the lobsters, get the traps off the boat, if we were, like, shifting gear or anything.  


        And then we'd put – get the winches going again.  Get the doors back on the boat.  Get the net reel – it was usually already on there.  And then we'd convert the next day, because everything is so regulated.  So you can only go shrimping certain days.  You can only go scalloping certain days.  And then in between, you can go lobstering.


        So those were my –what I'd like to call insanity years.  I had – I mean, that was crazy.  I mean, I can't believe that we did that.


        And on top of that, we then hired a packer.  She was a crab picker.  So we would just bring her our products.  We'd bring the shrimp to her.  She'd peel them.  She'd package them.  And then I'd go around and sell them to the different restaurants.  I mean, many of these restaurants, I've sold my product to.


        So that was part of that.  It was always trying to get the product back to the people, not always putting it on the truck and sending it to an auction or down to Portland or something like that.  I mean, our first choice is always to give back if we can.


Q:        [28:24] Yeah, you'd mention that you hold the lobster license.  Do you still hold that? 


A:        [28:27] I do.  Yep.  And I'll keep that.  So let me just quick to over what I've done.


        So when I knew – so like, three years – during COVID, however many years ago that was, whatever that was.  During those years, obviously, we didn't know what we were doing.  We were trying to figure out, where’s this going?  Is this my chance to get out of fishing?  Is this like, what are we going to do here?


        At the same time, my captain, his health started to decline.  He really needs a new hip.  He still hasn’t gotten this new hip.  That's another story.


        So it was really this crossing for me.  What do I do?  Do I try to make fishing work?  Do I not?  My daughter at this point was becoming a teenager.  


        So I decided to keep my lobster license, but not get a boat.  And so we started developing the concept of creating this mini golf course in Southwest Harbor called Golf of Maine.  And that was my opportunity to give back this legacy of like – I mean, sharing our fishing heritage and what we've done in stories has always been pretty important.  And so we thought mini golf would be really fun.  


        And then as we started researching more about mini golf – so I'm a huge mini golf fan.  Dave is a regular golf guy.  And we just started brainstorming these ideas on the boat that got out of control.  And now we have a mini golf course.


        So holding the lobster license is really important.  But I'm in this little speed bump of trying to get this business off the ground and everything.


        So last year was our first year.  Not to say I won't go back to lobstering, because if he gets his new hip, then I might go out fishing with him a little bit this coming summer, just to get back out.  Because summer lobstering, you really can't beat it.  If it's 85 degrees out, you can be out on the ocean.  And it's just such – that is a really – I miss that part of it.  Yeah.


Q:        [30:27] Great.


A:        [30:28] I do hold the license.


Q:        [30:29] Yeah.  Do you hold any other licenses?


A:         [30:30] I have a seaweed harvesting license.  And then I – I mean, as far as fishing, that's all I do.  But I have my – I’m an associate broker, too, for real estate.  So I do that.  I took my pilot's license.  So kind of diversified.


        Growing up around here, I mean, I know you guys are from other places, but I mean, everybody wants to learn as much as they can.  So that's right out of high school.  I was always pretty motivated.  And I got my pilot's license when I was a senior.  So yeah.  


        I had finished all my classes, and I couldn’t – I didn't know what to do.  So I started taking flying lessons in Trenton.  It was great.  And then all of a sudden, my teachers were like, where have you been?  And I hadn't told them.  And they’re about  – I mean, that was back in the day when you could sort of just not be in school and they didn't really follow up.  But at the end of the year, they were like, where have you been?  So I told my advisor, I said, I'm actually been flying.  He's like, like, airplanes.


        So he came to one of my pract – he came to one of my lessons, and met my instructor, and watched me do touch and goes and stuff.  And was like, OK, you can graduate.  You are good.  (laughter).  I showed him all my flying in for – like all the classes I had to take for that.  So yeah.


Q:        [31:46] Yeah, have you done much seaweed harvesting?  


A:        [31:48] A little bit.  Not – so that was something that during COVID too was very important for me to learn about and get that license because I didn't know if they were going to shut that down.  So that's another license I hold.  But at this moment, not doing anything with that.


        I really am interested in cultivating seaweed and scallops.  In the future, I want to keep all those things close because I'm really passionate about that.  But just with this new business and in this moment in time, it's not something I'm doing.  But I have plans.


        And so – I mean, even at the golf course, we talk about doing a little lobster hatchery, like a mini version, and stuff like that.  So in the future, that's what I'm hoping that the golf course property is going to be sort of a platform to be able to showcase a lot of those different things.  


        And actually, I'm really interested in you at the University of Maine because we have these backboards that we're putting together to put around the course.  And this will be our first official first season this coming year.  


        So we have all these backboards that we really want to obviously be factual.  But we come up with them and we find like our own information that we want to share.  But I would love to have somebody look them over and add input, or if you have students that are, like, want to help do anything like that, that would be very cool.


Q:        [33:13] Do you have any experience in the industry that's beyond directly fishing?  So maybe in bookkeeping, you talked about cleaning the boat, which I think sort of counts in that.  Or post-harvesting.  I think you also said you had a broker's license.  Advocacy, that sort of stuff.  Can you talk about that?


A:        [33:28] Yeah.  So bookkeeping is sort of a nightmare for anyone that's working 16 hours a day.  Taxes definitely have gotten me by the throat many times.  I've gotten better at it.  But I do – I'm in huge fear of some of these young guys that get a huge paycheck.  And then they just go blow the whole thing.  And then tax season comes up and they've got no clue what they're doing.  There's also very few accountants that have been helpful, and we've lost a lot of accountants in the area.  And I'm hoping that more – we get more to the area.  


        So the bookkeeping side of things is pretty straightforward.  It's just you've got to bank your money and know what you're doing.  And it's not – it's again.  If you don't take those classes in your senior – junior, senior year in high school, and you get right in the lobstering or you don't even finish high school, you really have no idea of how to maintain those practices or even how to start them.  So that's been one thing that's been really important.


        I actually have – there's a little – there’s a girl that's one of my daughter's friends and she's fishing with her aunt and her aunt's husband.  And she just told me the other day.  She goes, geez, Holly, I've got to file my taxes.  How do I do that?  She's 13.  


        And I'm like, I love where your mind is at.  Let's talk.  Not at this moment – because you guys are here or whatever, but I'd love to talk to you about that.


        And so and that's a young person who is aware, because it's been drilled into her head, you've got to pay your taxes.  You've got to do this.  And it's a big thing.  I mean, it's huge.


        I, for a few years, had Dave just keep my taxes out, but that's always been a thing.  That's always something that hangs over your head.  And – but it's the same thing for advocacy.  For going out and talking to these girls – or anybody.  


        A lot of the guys don't want to really – they like to talk.  They want to know what we're catching.  It's funny because the women are always inspired by me and want to talk about what it's like to be on a boat.  The men always want to know what we're catching and how much.  


        They always want to know where we're going.  They're more like, why are you guys doing so well?  And that type of thing.  So those are different things.


        I've given some talks at some schools, which is cool, and gone out and talked to them, and the library again in the historical society I've been pretty involved with.          And the Southwest Harbor Public Library is amazing.  They're great.


Q:        [35:52] Yeah.  And can you talk a little bit more about the ways that you feel like your back – your identity might shape your experience in the fishery and the way people treat or talk to you like you just mentioned?


A:        [36:02] Yeah.  So I've been a very large community member.  I'm pretty – that's a huge passion of mine.  And a big thing – when I look through my core values of my life and what I want, it's really to leave some sort of legacy to this area that – I mean, because I know that I was awesome.  For those years that I was doing all that, like I know that that was pretty crazy, because I look back on it and think, how did I do that?


        Like there are mornings now when I wake up, and I'm just like, I hear the wind blowing.  It's still dark out.  And I think to myself, how was I on the boat an hour ago?  For days, weeks, months on ends.  How did I do that?  I kind of blow myself away.  Like, wow.  Where was that motivation from?  Where did that come from?  Because I don't have that all the time now.  It's very different.


        So that's something that I just feel like – I lost my train of thought.  I'm sorry.  


        But being on the boat and what I've got going on now is really what I want.  And so that's what all these years of working up to is like, what do I really want for myself, which is kind of calling my own shots.  And being involved as I want to be.  


Q:        [37:28] Yeah.  And what would an average day of work sort of look like?  You've mentioned it a few times, but if you take me –


A:        [37:34] Yeah.  Oh my gosh.  Yeah.


Q:        [37:35] – through that whole day.


A:        [37:36] So wake up – so fishing, obviously.  So wake up by 4.35.  It's like, grab a quick cup of coffee.  If I can have my stuff together, I've got the coffee on an auto timer.  So it just makes it.  Didn't always do that.


        Try to grab something to eat on the boat.  I mean, that was one thing that was always a struggle for me was having enough food on the boat.  I mean, I'd get off and just be rav – I'd eat anything in sight.  I mean, I was just starving.  I’ve burned 5,000 calories a day sometimes,  just moving literally from five o'clock in the morning some – for 12 straight hours. 


        I mean, sometimes you don't even have time to go to the bathroom.  You don't have anything.  I mean, the traps are coming quick.  There's so much to do.  And so for one thing for me, I'd always laugh at it.  


        It was usually just Dave and I on the boat.  And we would kill it.  I mean, some days we'd have 2,400 pounds of lobsters, just him and I.  And so – and then we'd come into the dock and we'd be in line to sell our lobsters.  And I'll see a boat with a captain and two crew, two guys.  And I'm just like, I got you.  We just did the same thing, if not better.  And it's just me.


        So you have no time, though.  Your hands are just ju-ju-ju-ju all the time.  So that was always really stressful.


        So get up in the morning, try to get that cup of coffee, try to get some food in a bag.  And again, you're going non-stop.  So you miss the grocery store.  I mean, in Southwest, the grocery store closes at 6, sometimes 7 if you're lucky.  You're getting gas station food.  It's disgusting.  You feel like crap.  Going through the health cycles now of trying to eat better has been really good for me.


        So you get on the boat and it's like getting bait.  We usually got bait in the morning.  Sometimes we put it on the night before.  But if we had to get bait in the morning, so it's like going to the bait cooler, going and loading up the truck, bringing that to the dock, bringing the boat around, hoisting it down.  Like the whole process would take anywhere from a half hour to an hour, depending on what we were doing.  It would also dictate when we started our day, trying to get out there as early as possible.


        So I have beautiful sunrise photos, which I do miss the sunrise more than anything on the ocean.  


        And then it was just like that first trap comes aboard.  And sometimes it comes aboard five seconds leaving the dock.  Sometimes it's an hour.  We have to steam offshore, depending on what the tide's doing, what the weather's going to do for the day, depends on where we're going to start.  


        If we're going to shift traps, then that will decide are we going to go to this string first?  Haul those, then go pick those up and move those over here.  Are we going to start out off Duck Island and work our way back?  


        I mean, all those conversations are usually happening mostly with Dave in his head and then us together trying to figure out what we're going to do for the day, like what's our goal?  Are we going to try to haul 200?  Are we going to try to haul 300, 400?  What's our plan for the day will sort of dictate what that's going to look like.  And then get all the lobsters.


        And in the minute we haul the last trap, it's start crating all the lobsters up, cleaning up the boat, putting – if there's any bait left, putting the bait away.  Just kind of tidying up.


        If you're scalloping, then it's usually a long steam.  Like right now, depending on where the guys are going, this is closed.  They're going over off Swan's Island and Marshall Island and over there.  So that's a two, three-hour steam sometimes.  So that's usually me.  And that's a different boat.  So we have two different boats.  We have the Dragger and the Lobster Boat.


        The Dragger – I'd make a pot of coffee if it wasn't frozen.  It would be many times I'd get down to the boat and go, “Damn it.”  And the whole thing and everything is just frozen.  So it takes a little bit to thaw everything out.  Make coffee.  Get ready for scalloping is pretty – it takes like 10 minutes to kind of get prepped.  Because I usually leave it ready to go at the end of the day.  


        And then we go out and we'd set out our first toe for scalloping.  You can't set out until sunrise.  So you can have like – we usually would get right where we want to go.  Because you want to claim that spot.  You want to clean that territory.  So you deploy your drag right off the corner of the boat.  And you hold it there.  And you just kind of circle around until you get the time call.  And – which is sunrise at Augusta.  It's not our sunrise or anything like that.  It's always calculated by Augusta sunrise.


        So the minute we'd get that, you know, be watching the clock.  And if there's wardens out, they're all watching the clock too.  So everyone's like waiting.  And then it's just kind of like – and then it's go time.  


        And then you just – I mean, from that moment on, we deploy the drag.  Hopefully we've got scallops in that first toe.  And it's anywhere from – I mean, we did three minute toes in Gouldsboro.  And we'd get eight, nine bushels of scallops in one three minute toe, which is crazy.  I don't think they're seeing that anymore.  But that was years ago.


        I mean, that was a really quick toe.  And you'd load up your scallops.  And then you'd dump the bag.  And then it would just start shelling them out and doing it again until you got your limit.


        So you had to sort of – for scalloping, you had to decide what your bushel count was going to look like.  So we’re only allowed 15 gallons a day.  So we're trying – or 135 pounds.  So we're trying to figure out like, what are these going to cut out to?  


        So sometimes they’re really big, sometimes they’re really small.  And that will decide like how many bushels we're going to take for the day.  And then as soon as we think we've gotten about the rough amount that we need to fulfill that limit, then we start heading home, and we shell them out the whole way, and clean up the boat, package them up.  We have a scale on the boat.  So we usually just weigh everything there and then I'll deliver.


        So some days we'd be done by noon.  You know, we’d leave early, but we'd be done by noon.  And then I'd spend my afternoon bringing scallops to everybody.  So that's a little different this year because it's taking longer to get the scallops and they're going further distance, so they're not getting back until like six at night.  So we just get them first thing in the morning.


Q:        [43:34] And can you talk a little bit more about how these roles in fishing sort of interacted with your family or caregiving responsibilities?


A:        [43:41] Oh my gosh, yeah, that caused so much trouble.  You know, there's – it's one thing when you're a single person with no child, you know?  My responsibilities are my own and whatever.  When you have a small human, you're then very responsible, obviously.  And I had to depend on other people to help me get through that period of my life.  So there is a lot of stress there.  A lot of guilt.  You know?  If I miss something.


        The other thing with fishing is that Dave has his own kids.  And so he knew, you know, like this is important, this is important.  I got to be in for this.  I got to be in for that.  And yeah, we didn't make as much money, but whatever.  It was, nothing we were willing to sacrifice.


        So there was a lot of pressure, like my mom helped me a lot.  Eden’s other grandmother, unfortunately, passed away when she was young.  But in those first two years she was very available.  


        And you just – you know, I missed weddings.  I missed things with friends that they didn’t understand the lifestyle.  So they don’t – they’re not as forgiving when you miss an important event for them because you’re gone, and you can’t be there.  So I had some relationships kind of – you know?  It just happens.  But they fizzled away.  


        And I had to call on a lot of people to help me.  I mean, my mom got me through.  I mean, there was days where I’d come and there’d be food in my fridge because she know I couldn’t make it to the grocery store.  That I was starving, and, you know, there’s only so many restaurants in the winter time, or anything like that.  You eat out a lot.  I mean, that became a huge thing because I just didn’t have the energy to want to cook, or prep, or anything – or shop.  Didn’t have the ability to do that so we ate a lot.  


        And – yeah.  And then once – as Eden got older though, that’s when I really started to like, I’ve got to take a step off this boat more.  I got to not be here as much.  And that's where I am today.


Q:        [45:39] And how do you think that will change as you look towards the future?


A:        [45:43] I think that I've just built a very good foundation for showing Eden what work ethic is all about.  I mean, she saw me get up many mornings and go to work.  And I think that's important.  


        And as I get older, I do – I mean, I've only been out of fishing now for about a year.  So as I look back on that lifestyle, I look back on things that I wish I had done differently.  And, you know, I wish I had asked for a little bit more time off in certain areas.  But again, I made a lot of money.  And I – you know, I bought real estate. I got myself to where I am today.  


        So I think going forward, it's really more about self-care and taking care of myself, and being there for Eden, and those moments that are really important to her and me.  And so that's sort of what my life is now.


Q:        [46:34] Yeah, absolutely. And then sort of switching gears, can you describe any changes in the marine environment you've noticed in your time in the water? 


A:        [46:42] Oh my gosh.  Well, starting with October 20 years ago, snow and ice.  We don't see that anymore.  That's huge.  


        The lobsters definitely go through cycles.  They like cold water, obviously.  So we're seeing that trend of them going into deeper holes in the ocean.  And we're seeing them go further offshore, not coming back as soon.  


        There's, you know, obviously the weather events that we've just experienced over the last couple of weeks, like what the heck was that?  Like Holy cow.  I mean, I've lived here for 40 – almost 44 years.  I've never seen Beale’s underwater ever.  And I live right down the street from there.  


        So that's scary.  I mean, honestly, it's terrifying.  I don't know what's going to happen.  And I didn't think – I mean, you always hear about climate change.  You hear about the warming ocean.  You hear about all these changes.  And you just – until you see it, it's really hard to grasp that Holy cow, this is actually probably happening.  


        And so you do kind of start changing your mindset a little bit of like, OK, maybe I'm not so focused on this one thing.  Maybe there are other things happening here, but until you witness it and see it.  


        And the bait situation is changing huge.  So the guys are out pogie fishing now during the summer months. And that's providing most of the bait fish for local fishermen around here.  So they'll go out fishing.  They'll – pogie fishing.  They'll get the fish.  They come in.  They'll sell it directly to the fishermen or to a wharf.  


        That's different because we've usually gotten herring.  I mean, I used to go down to Portland and get, you know, redfish racks or, you know, any of the better bait – lobster candy, we used to call it, because we'd put that on the lobster – we put those in traps like, oh my gosh – certain types of redfish or depending on the quality of the fish, if it was really fresh or if it was, you know, like a really salted bait or something.  Just it reac – lobsters react differently.  


        And we spent my entire like 20 years figuring out, like we'd bait one trap with old stinky, nasty like bait that you think of.  And then we'd bait it with like really fresh, fresh, fresh, and see the difference.  And depending on what cycle the lobsters were in, if they were shedding or if they were hard, you know, depending on what they were, we saw those changes.  


        And so over the years, we really developed a kind of a bait master plan to be like, OK, this type of year you use this, this type of year you use that.  And whatever we can get better quality, we will. 


        Well, what's happened over the last 10 years, those prices have gone through the roof.  And so the marine fisheries has opened up this pogie fishing, which has just really been a savior.  Huge.  Because it's a fish that is not food quality, but it's also right here.  I mean, we see – for the few years leading up to them being able to pogie fish, the schools of porgies was insane.  


        I mean, I have videos of like pan shots of like 12 huge, massive, you know, just obviously things chasing them to the surface.  And incredible,  Nature.  Incredible.  I mean, a really fun thing to experience.  


        Whales, sharks, I mean, you name it, everything, just going at them. Seals like, oh my gosh.  Tuna, we – like everything.  Was really fun.  Yeah.  


Q:        [50:12] Yeah. And how the aside from bait, like how do you think those environmental changes have affected your work in the sector? 


A:        [50:18] We – well, the bait has been a big one for the financial side of everything because obviously you go from spending 50,000 a year on herring and whatever to whatever you can get for barrels of porgies off a local boat is a lot different.


        We actually have – my little brother is almost 20 and he actually goes pogie fish – He goes lobster  and – but he also goes pogie fishing.  So he's basically our guy.   He's our bait guy.  And he uses his dad's boat.  So it's like we can get that a lot cheaper. 


        But those were – that's changing.  I mean, the one thing too is people shifted from this fresh bait right off the boats and barrels to this frozen bait, which I don't know if you've aware of all that, but the plastic and the cardboard used for that is disgraceful.  It's pathetic.  And it's really sad that we even went through a transition period of a couple of years of using so much of that, because the waste that came out of that was – it was really sad to see that.  


        But a very easy product.  You see the trucks going by with it just hay racked, and they can transport it that way.  And one person can pick those boxes up.  They weigh anywhere from 40 to 80 pounds.  So one person can pick up one of those boxes of fish that's anywhere – it's like this.  You pick it up and you just sling it on the boat and you leave it there and then by the next morning, depending on what the weather is doing, it's thawed out and ready to go the next day.


        So it was very practical but not from a conservative side at all. So I was really happy when that sort of has started to kind of go away a little bit.  I mean people clearly still use that stuff, but it's nice to see a better product. 


        So that's a big change because that affects price, you know, your bottom dollar.  I mean, that just affects everything.


Q:        [52:11] Yeah, and are there any other ways that you sort of coped with those changes or addressed them?


A:        [52:16] Yeah, changing to porgies. That's the big one.  The other thing is the boats, just going back to climate change and just different things that have changed. 


        So weather patterns as they get – I mean we're getting better obviously, and we have over the last 20, 30 years of like predicting weather, knowing what's coming and all that.  


        But these boats are getting faster, the boats are getting bigger, the men are getting more egotistical and a little bit more daring.  So they're going out in some pretty wacky weather that – I don't know how that changes, because in their mindset they're like I can do this.  You know this boat can handle it.  The boat can handle it.  That's – I've heard that so many times.  Like the boat – whatever.  I got this boat.  I just spent a million dollars on this boat.  This boat is going to go fishing because it needs to. 


        So as the weather patterns change I do see the guys getting a little bit – they're still fearless and they're still going out.  And that scares me.  That's one thing. 


        I mean we've lost guys.  We know people that we've lost.  And it's – that's something that's really scary. 


Q:        [53:20] Yeah and you had mentioned also just the temperature change for the lobsters.  Can you describe a little bit more about that? 


Q:        [53:24] Well one big thing for lobsters on the boat too is that if you have holding tanks, they need to be in obviously ocean water until you sell them.  There are some guys that don't do that.  They'll just leave them in crates on the deck of the boat, and they come in, and it's warm out.  And the lobsters are already in a weak state.  And then you put them on a deck of a boat with no water for however many hours, and then the heat – you're selling a dead product at that point. 


        So fishermen have gotten better from the – I mean we got good at it because we had like a sprinkler system and we had all this.  So if we're catching a thousand, two thousand pounds a day,  we had a tank that was keeping ocean water on them and then we had the sprinkler system that we could put 15 crates with this like hose water to keep them cool. 


        But if it was going to be really hot or anything like that in the summertime, we just go in and unload.  Sometimes we'd unload twice a day just to keep that product alive and to maintain that. 


        But the – but not everyone does that, so you know, that comes back to the industry because that affects the bottom dollar on everybody.  If they're buying dead lobsters that's going to drive the price down.  So that's huge. 


        And then as fishermen, when we go to meetings which unfortunately through COVID the meetings on the fishermen for the different – what am I trying to say?  The different zones.  So there's always zone meetings.  So there's like eight or nine zones.  


        There's – we use to have really good zone meetings and I would go to them and I would learn something.  Wouldn't really say much.  I did a couple times and was just like it's very intimidating situation, but they haven't – they don't really do those anymore.  


        But that was a chance to go and talk to guys.  I mean, obviously everyone talks at  the dock.  You pull down to a dock anywhere in Maine, there's a fisherman there.  If he's in a decent mood he could chat with you for hours.  If he's in a bad mood, doesn't want to talk to you, you know, it's clearly obvious. 


        But one thing we always talk about is product quality and making sure that the lobsters are not dead.  And if you're leaving them in the traps too long they get weaker.  I mean, there's a lot of things that factor the quality of the lobster. 


Q:        [55:33] Yeah, and with these recent storms, do you find a lot of people are talking about that now too? 


A:        [55:39] It's – so yes.  Actually I'm going to say not so much, because right now I think people are really just trying to figure out how to get through the winter and dealing with storm damage.  And then – I mean, there's people that have lost their boats so I mean that goes back to square one for them.  


        I mean, depending on what their insurance is, not only that, to get a new boat, you'd either got to go buy an existing boat.  Repair your boat.  Those things are huge because you can't find people to work on them.  I mean, it goes down to supply chain issues of like all the gear that's needed, the lost traps is insane. 


        I mean, I don't know if you've heard anything about that but I mean people – that's hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars worth a gear that gets destroyed in big storms like that, and I know this one wiped a lot out.  And people weren't expecting that.  I think they were expecting big tides and like, you know, big weather.  But nothing as destructive as what we just saw.  


        So now you've got to build yourself back up.  And the banks – I know a lot of banks aren't loaning to fishermen right now.  High interest rates, all that just comes right back down to the fishermen.  Because now they're basically wiped out, and they need to start over, and they've got nothing to sell because you've just lost your product.  And insurance companies don't necessarily cover lost gear. 


Q:        [57:05] Yeah, and in terms of just thinking about like the porgies for instance.  Do you think that that's really helped especially looking towards the future.


A:        [57:13] Huge.  Huge.  That's huge.  Not only that, it's given fishermen during the lull of making money in the summertime, income.  And for us – so Luke will take his buddies out who are also lobster men, and he needs the hands on deck.  He needs a couple of guys to help him pogie fish, so he just – he pays them in barrels of bait.  So that works for everybody.


        And so those are things that are hugely affecting the industry in a really positive way.


Q:        [57:43] And do you think there's anything else like the pogie fishing that is really working to like sort of approach these environmental changes? 


A:        [57:50] I can't think of anything right off the top on my head, because that's the biggest one.  It's really, the storm damage is what I'm most concerned about, like for our harbor.  Beals is officially closed until April so that means no fishermen are going in there right now.  We've got some issues with like MDI Lobster has gone out of business.  We don't know what's going on there.  There's damage repairs that need to happen.  


        So, I mean, some of these fishermen do fish year-round.  Lobstering, we're talking.  So they're fishing year-round and they have nowhere to go necessarily.  Or they have to have a truck meet them.  


        Rich’s Wharf over in Bass Harbor completely demolished.  Like you can’t even step foot on that dock.  I mean, that's a year-round dock for many people.  Same thing with Thurston's.  I mean, these are established infrastructures for the industry that, right now, are wiped out.


        So how that's going to affect everybody this spring will be huge because there'll be a lot of changes that need to happen.  And what caused that?  This very large storm. 


        So, I mean, that's one thing that's that's – it does – there's multi layers of that. 


Q:        [59:04] How do you think – how do you think people are going to sort of address that going forward? 


A:        [59:10] That is a good one.  I don't know. I think there's a lot of fishermen that are really scared.  They don't know.  I mean, there's – well-established.  They'll get through anything.  They've been doing this for 50 years.  They'll figure it out. 


        Some of the newer guys, I think they've just been given this gravy season over the last 10 years that they've been involved.  They don't know how bad it can be.  And if you haven't been through despair like that. I mean, I don't know.  I'm not sure.


        But there is a very good generation of like the young 20-year-olds, but they've – excuse me – they've just been given – you know, they've worked really hard.  They deserve it, they've been out.  There they've done that.  But they don't know what it's like to really struggle because they've their parents – you know, everyone's helped them get to where they are.  They've worked their asses off for it and they deserve it, but they haven't actually seen what it's like when things go the other way. 


F:        [1:00:12] I was going to ask, you mentioned about the issue of like heat and kind of the product degradation, or like dying of the lobsters on – on the boats.  And that you guys have the better system of like holding tanks and sprinklers.  I was just wondering, was that something you built in response to kind of changing weather patterns.  Like you invested in a ecological change.


A:        [1:00:28] Yeah, completely.  Yeah.  That, and, oh, if I could remember the year.  I want to say it was like 2005 is when we started getting over a thousand pounds regularly, and our holding tank couldn't hold that.  


        So we noticed when we got to the docks  sluggish lobsters.  And then, the guys buying lobsters would be like, OK, you're not –  we haven't lost any of yours but we're losing other people, so like what's going to happen here?  So we installed another Pacer pump on the boat and then added this whole new – it's very simple.  


        I mean, my captain put the whole thing together for like $300 or $400 other than the Pacer pump.  And it worked like a champ.  It was great.  I got sprayed in the face a trillion times, but it was really – it worked.  


        But that was definitely in response to a higher level of catch – increased huge – almost – not – I'm not going to say overnight, but it was almost like from one season to the next, it was a significant uptick in what we were catching.  And then, yeah, the warm weather in the summertime.  


        And even in the winter, I mean, sometimes it'd be too cold, so you'd like, you kind of had to regulate that depending on what season it was and what was going on.


A:        [1:01:42] Yeah.  And you sort of talked about this already, but are – do you feel that there are any particular resources, relationships, knowledge, training organizations, like those sort of things, that you really drawn on to adapt to these things?


Q:        [1:01:54] So I was a huge fan of these zone council meetings and going to those.  They don't exist anymore.  From what I've gathered too, they've gotten very political and there are more just information sessions for from what I've gathered.


        Augusta just shows up and kind of just says what's happening with very limited – public comment is available but it doesn't do anything, so that's too bad.   But more so just, I think, through Facebook groups.  You know?  You connect with people that you don't know about.  Like this Ali Farrell that wrote this book “Pretty Rugged.”


        She contacted me via a Facebook post and we became really good friends.  You know?  And she did this great book so – and then we ended up doing – we wanted to go on tour.  We made a joke we wanted to go on tour.  But like seven or eight of the women, we all got together.  And then we did like a public talk for the library.  We did a few different public engagements.  And it was really fun to be able to like connect with them, and meet them, and then know that like, oh my, gosh, you guys, we're all going through the same struggles of parenting, and the guilt of not always being their first thing in the morning, or I'd get home so late at night my daughter was already sleeping.  I missed her the whole day.  And so there was some really dark days for me of feeling really guilty, so it was really nice to have that resource of like, wow, there are other people out there.


        So Facebook not that I love Facebook, but it exists and it has been a really good way to network and connect with others.  I do try to attend anything that I can that interests me.  At the Penobscot Museum I know they did like a women's fishing thing, that was really cool.  


        Rockland for the lobster association big meeting, the convention that they do down there.  It's good during the day.  The evening there is not so much fun.  To many people it is, but it's more of a way to get together and get drunk and – but the information there is really cool.


        And other resources – really just my community.  I mean, I feel like I've been a really good resource for people.  I've had you know women – or young girls approaching me with their application for their apprenticeship, and I think that's really kind of when I decided that I'm there.  I'm at a point in my life where I feel like I am a good resource and I do have enough information to offer back to these people now.  So like I feel good about that.  I feel very secure in what I am.  So I try to be a resource.  But, yeah.


        And then the restaurant, the chefs actually have been really great.  I mean, I have connected – when I was 15 and delivering seafood from the fish market, that's where I started off was, you know, going to restaurants and bringing them to these chefs directly.  And they'd be like, wow, this is an amazing product, because they you know they're used to Maine Shellfish, or they're used to these other delivery trucks.  And then, so I'm bringing it literally from the boat to them.  And, you know, the mileage on that is like sometimes less than five miles.  So that's pretty incredible.  But, yeah


        They would give me more information as far as like protein and just the quality of the product, so that's something that really got nailed home to me when I was young is knowing just how good of a product seafood is, and the protein, and the nutrients.  Like it's incredible.  So.


Q:        [1:05:23] Yeah, and you mentioned with like the holding tank, just being able to do that.  Do you feel like you've been able to make a lot of the – like adapt to a lot of the changes in the way you wanted to. 


A:        [1:05:32] Definitely.  I mean, we've always said you have to roll with the punches.  And so – and one thing.  And here when we started weighing the pros and cons versus fishing versus minigolf, minigolf there are zero regulations.  And we just like – as we get like emails or texts about like, oh, regulation change, or you know rule change.  Like how many times do we see rule change come up on an email or some – oh, roll your eyes and think like now what?  What do we got to do now?  Like, oh, the measure’s got to be changed now.  Or you know, the vents have to be changed out now.  Or, oh, these links don't work.  Or the marine patrol come on the boat and they want to like measure all your circles for your – your drag and make sure those aren't stretched out, or you know.  


        So all these things are like constantly changing.  And then we get minigolf, like zero regulation, and you can make up your own rules.  It's so great.


        So really, like it's been funny for us but also like eye opening to the amount of things that we've had to adapt to and change over the years to appease these different regulations and, yeah, some of them are great.  Some of them are pain-in-the-you-know-what and – but, I mean, it's part of the industry.  So you – I mean, as much as you can go to meetings and try to say your peace, it's happening.


Q:        [1:06:47] Yeah, and are there kinds of adaptations you wish you would have been able to make to like access different things that you haven't been able to.


A:        [1:06:54] So when the ropeless trap guy approached me four or five years ago, I wish I would have – I did give him a lot of my time.  I wish we would have tried his gear a couple years ago.  Because now I'm not on the boat, it's harder for me to like be part of that.  And I think he was on to something.  But we talked heavily about like – he brought that up – up here.  It's called Lobster Lift is the name of the company.  And he was great.  And I loved his products, but there were so many things that I saw wrong with it like that.


        So I worked with him for about a year back and forth, and that's one regret I have is that I'm not working with him now to bring that more to frutation (sic) because it's a really good product.


        And it’s – the technology is there and I believe it's going to work.  The problem is the current state of fishing is not that.  Like if we – if this was a brand new fishery, and you were trying to like, oh, this is how you do it.  OK.  Unfortunately you have a very ancient way of doing things with ancient mindsets.  So to change all that is almost impossible.  And so where they meet in the middle is what the problem is.  And that I don't know.  And I don't know how to bring that together.


        There was a lot of rumors going around about boats getting sunk for helping these guys, about traps getting cut off and all that.  So we sort of had to – unfortunately, we had to kind of make a social call, that if we help this guy or be part of this, like we don't want to be part of the negative effects of that right now, because he still has a long way to go to figure that out.  But I met with him kind of as much as I could.


Q:        [1:08:44] Yeah, and this is kind of a long question, so I'll read the whole thing.  What is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future for Maine’s coastal fisheries.  And if you could tell policymakers in Maine what their biggest priority should be to help people adapt to these changes, what would you tell them?


A:        [1:09:01] So policy is something that without knowing what the new policies are, it's very hard to make a statement or to know which way to go.  Because for me, I know – I mean, I consider myself a fairly intelligent person.  But when I read a new rule or a new policy, I've no idea what it means.  No clue.  And so – and the, you know, and the kind of conversation is always like, oh, they do that to confuse you.  Like that's just a throw it off to get you to vote one way or another way when really this is what they're what they're trying to achieve.


        So one thing that I think would be really important would be – and we had observers for a long time.  And observers are not the answer.  I don't I'm not saying that that's what we need, but we need people that will come out on the boat and see what's really happening and learn more about what the day-to-day fishery looks like, not necessarily what it looks like in an office somewhere.  Because, I mean, you can get a report, and you can think you know what's going on, but unless you're actually on the water, you've got no idea.  


        And so, Kathleen Reardon.  Do you know Kathleen?  She worked for DMR.  She's out of Damariscotta.  She's amazing and I like – have a true friend in her.   


        So she would come out and sample lobsters with us several times over the last 20 years.  She was one of the most like neutral people I ever dealt with, which is great.  She’d come on the boat.  She would be miked.  And she would measure every single lobster that came aboard the boat.  Sometimes it was 4,000 pounds worth of lobsters.  I mean, every lobster – even if it was dead, she – and no matter the size she would mic – and she would give just the data report.  And so she – that information was so important.  


        And so she would be really great at informing us on like new policies, talking to us like real people, not through an email with like 800 different bullet points.  It was like, this is what's going on.  And she'd be real.


        So if you could get more people like her that could come and talk to us and be on the boat with us, because you have a level of respect for someone that comes and is meeting you at the boat at four o'clock in the morning, and staying with you all day, and she kicked butt.  Like she was great.


        So more people like that that actually have a passion for the future of the fishery would be huge.  And the fishermen lose respect quickly when they you, you know, when they're being told what to do by someone that's never even been on a boat before.  And that's just the way it is.


Q:        [1:11:45] Yeah, and sort of switching gears again, and thinking about climate and resilience and strategies for that, have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation programs for bans for fishing.


A:        [1:11:57] Other than the LobsterLift, that's about it.  


Q:        [1:12:01] And to the point of the LobsterLift, do you think attending that was helpful for your thinking about (inaudible; overlapping dialogue).


A:        [1:12:07] Totally.  A hundred percent.  Oh my gosh.  Like I still think – so Cormac, and I could give you his information.  He would be happy.  He loved them.  I mean, this is his passion.  He went to Malaysia and won a huge technology award.  So he was actually sponsored by NOAA, which is when we had to stop kind of working with him, was when we found where his funding was coming from.  That was just like a huge no-no for fishermen at the time.  


        Now, it's been a couple years.  It's like the mindset, I still think is kind of not there yet.  Well, I know it's not.  But he has a really good idea.  And that was – it's something that I hope that he is continuing with because he wanted us to deploy all this.


        The other thing is these big storms, your traps would be safe.  I mean, they might tumble around a little bit, and like, yeah, there’s stuff down there.  


        The problem is with these traps is that when they get tangled up with something else, or who knows what, they're gone.  But this LobsterLift thing, I mean it’s – there's – I definitely have done the pros and the cons for that too, and I can see where it's a really good product.  It's just how do you how do you merge ancient theory with technology of the future.  And so with anything that's where the problem lies.  


        But that's an organization that I – I definitely – I support him in figuring that out, and other people that are.  And I know there's – I think he said – at the time this was – and I'm talking two years ago.  I saw him last year, but two years ago when he was really heavy into this, there were seven companies at the time trying to develop that technology, and I think there's just more now.  And it has advanced.  


        But that was one thing that's like, wow.  If – you know, the storm – your traps would be safe.  Or safer.  We don’t want to say totally safe.  But they – better chance of getting them back, which would be huge.


Q:        [1:14:00] And what strategies do you think would be effective in continuing to build resilience against climate related impacts.


A:        [1:14:09] So the docks, I think are now, they're the ones that are really dealing with this the most because – like Justin Snyder at Beals, I don't know if you've talked to him.  He's huge climate change.  And so he is – and actually a really good person for you guys to talk to too because he's very open-minded to climate change.  


        He's from Florida.  You know?  He – his family bought Beals several years ago, many years ago now, but he's dealing with that right now.  Like what do you do to your dock?  I mean, it happened once when’s the next time it's going to happen.  Like, if we have another high tide like that in six months from now, like crap, you're going to go repair everything and then it's going to happen again?  You know, you’ve got to make some adjustments and, you know, where does the – how much money does that cost, and what does that look like?  So that's a that's a big one.  


        But for us personally right now it's not affecting – it's not going to affect me because I'm not on the boat right now.  But for my family, it will affect everything.  


        And even Devon clamming – I mean we haven't found – so he doesn't go clamming this time a year, but we've seen the photos of the clams being washed up on shore.  Like wow.  That hasn't happened yet in our lifetime, but now we're witnessing it.  So when's the next cycle of that happening again?  So if it hasn't happened for 40 years, but it happened once, if it happens again in the next couple years, like we know the pattern here.  So if that continues to happen, that's crazy.


Q:        [1:15:32] And are there any other types of changes, like maybe not environment.  You talk to a little bit about social, that are impacting your work and you want to tell us about?


A:        [1:15:41] Again, hard to be responding when I'm not on the boat so much, but really, I think – I mean for us for right now for Southwest Harbor anyway, I'll just focus on that, is we have one dock out of business.  We have another one completely wrecked.  And we've got a dry – we've got a – we have trucks that come and buy on the pier.  Well right now they're saying our pier's not safe.  


        So those are huge, I mean.  And those were all affected.  Those storms kind of knocked out our infrastructure hopefully only for the short term, but something that people are going to be thinking more about.  


        I know the harbor committee in Southwest Harbor is – this is the – I mean, health and emergency meeting right after that all happened because it wiped out everything.  And it destroyed our coastline.  So, I mean, there's a lot of things that need to be figured out.


Q:        [1:16:34] Do you have any thoughts on how people are going to sort of like cope or adapt with that towards the future?


A:        [1:16:38] I don't know.  Justin would be a good one to talk to because he's – right now, I know he's talking to Washington, and I know he's trying to figure out funding for himself and for others.  He's donated all their products because the, like – I don't know if you've been in Beals, but there's hatches there, and all the water went through the hatches.  And he said it was like a whale blow hole.  It was insane, and they ended up losing all their products through the hatches.  So they had like crab meat was floating around the harbor.  I mean, they lost everything.  So how they adapt now is huge – I have no idea.


        Coast Guard too.  The Coast Guard was underwater.  I mean, all those places.  It’s huge amounts of damage.  But how they go forward, I don't know.  The boats – we thankfully were at the breakwater at Dystart’s, so that didn't affect our boat.  But everything is broken.  I mean there's – it’s just shackles.  Everything falling apart.  


Q:     [1:17:36] Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes you've experienced during the time on the water?


A:        [1:17:41] I definitely think interviews like this – I mean, when I get asked to talk or like say my piece about any of it, I think that's really cool and I'm happy to do that, and I think that that's something that I want to continue to do.  The golf course is my platform from here on out as – you know, we're talking about doing like talks there, and doing different demonstrations there and different things.  


        So going forward from me that will be what I do.  That will be my focus for the next five to 10 years is being able to provide a place for locals, for visitors, for groups, for everybody to come and learn about the fishing industry through my eyes and through Dave's eyes.  So that's my that's my goal.  (laughter)


Q:        [1:18:28] Yeah, and what is sort of your hopeful vision for the future of Maine fisheries.


A:         [1:18:32] I hope that honestly, that little kids know what it's like to be part of the fishing community, because I go into like Pemetic, I go into some of these elementary schools, and Eden just graduated from Pemetic as an eighth grader last year, and there are very few fishing families still part of that community.  And it's sad.  


        So my hope is that we maintain a connection, and that the people moving here too that are not from here that don't have immediate connections to the fisheries and to the different – you know, just the ocean in general, that they learn about it.


        And I have people that, you know, come up to me and ask me like oh, will you take my son out we don't ever anyone in the fish – we don't anyone in the family that fishes, could you take him out?  And we've done that a couple times.  But it would be really great to have more of a youth program for folks.  


        I mean, even here at the COA, I mean, talks.  All that.  Getting just the community connection and just making sure that it's really the youth that are learning about what the fisheries are all about.


Q:        [1:19:38] Great.  Thank you.  And is there anything else you wanted to share with us before we end the interview?


A:        [1:19:44] I don't know that it was a lot.  (laughter).  I don't know.  Yeah, I don’t think I do.  I mean, I'm not trying to like totally plug my business, but it really is, like, that was the whole vision for the Golf of Maine was to create a place that people could come and learn about it.  


        And when we've really started talking about that new business was when we were in jeopardy of, oh, my gosh, are we actually not fishing?  Is that what's happening right now? 


        I mean, we have the commissioner telling us not to go, like what's happening?  Like that – this is all new.  This is a new, like what's going on.  So we really did want to create a place where we could talk about these things, and showcase them, and have things on display that were not totally manufactured in a theme park thing, that there was real, like – this is like – I caught that.  Like that's scallop shells, and those are different things that we – bottles.  Like different things we actually found fishing, and then talk to that about people.


        And so last year, our first year, being open, I can't even tell you how gratifying it was to have the people that showed up to play golf, that didn't know we were there first off, and then they're like, oh. we didn't know we were here.  This wasn't here last year.  And then to start the conversation about fishing is what it's all about.  I mean, for me that's really going forward, is just giving back something that I know a little bit about that I think is really fascinating.


        Yeah.


Q:        [1:21:18] Great.  Thank you so much.  Do you have any other questions?


F:        [1:21:20] I mean, there’s just one clarifying question about you’re saying like this morning you're delivering scallops, but so I wasn't sure if that's your –


Q:        [1:21:28] So it's my step-dad.


F:        [1:21:29] Your step-dad.  It could be his scallops right now.


Q:        [1:21:31] Yeah, so he's scalloping right now with his son, Luke.  So they go out.  They can catch 15 gallons a day.  So he'll – 


F:        [1:21:37] And then he’ll sell –


Q:        [1:21:38] And then I sell them.  Yeah.


F:        [1:21:39] And you're going to both like direct to consumers and to restaurants?


A:        [1:21:42] Totally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And myself.  (laughter)


F:        [1:21:44] Do you (inaudible)?


A:        [1:21:45] I'm filling my own freezer, which is nice.  (laughter)  I've never – I actually – we always eat scallops when we're out fishing, because I always – like I have a fry pan and stuff on the boat, so we're always cooking them.  But it's been really weird for me to like get home now and cook them, because I never did that.  I just ate them on the boat.  


        Like I'd, you know, I'd bring food and you have a grill on the boat.  I mean, we ate – well, like – scalloping – when you're – dragging is much different than lobstering.  There's a lot more time like steaming-wise to like make food.  But yeah, this is the first year that I've been like making scallops at home now.  It's great.  I love it.


Q:        [1:22:20] I understand.  An animal product (inaudible: overlapping dialogue).


A:        [1:22:22] Yeah.


Q:        [1:22:23] You knew so well, you’re like free baking up a relationship and then you eat it.


F:        [1:22:25] Yeah.  Yeah. And when I'm cooking them and they're still moving it's like, that's amazing.  Yeah.


 Q:        [1:22:31] Great.  Well, thank you.  I’m going to go and turn this off.


A:        [1:22:33] Sure.


END OF FILE"
"20","A:        [0:00] Here we go.


Q:        [0:02] Great.  Does it show that you're recording?  Awesome.


A:        [0:05] Yes.  


Q:        [0:07] I would love if we could just start with how do you to like introduce yourself?


A:        [0:12] Yeah.  My name is Claire Mauer and I'm currently doing many things right now in work life.  But yeah, I've on and off full time and right now it's kind of a little bit on the back but I've run an aquaculture startup doing technology.  


I've cooked on and off in Portland and right now I have a full time job at an advertising agency and I'm a grad student, so a lot of different things going on.


Q:        [0:45] Great.  Thank you so much.  And what year were you born?


A:        [0:48] I was born in 1997.


Q:        [0:51] And can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:54] I grew up in Freeport on the water right there.  Looked out at the – where the Cousins River and the Royal River meet.  So I grew up very close to the water.  Pretty much interacting with it every day on the coast of Maine.


Q:        [1:12] Great.  And can you describe for me what your parents did when you grew up? What they're doing now?


A:        [1:18] Yeah.  Both my parents worked in natural medicine kind of.  My dad was a naturopathic doctor.  My mom was an acupuncturist.  My dad still works and he's transitioned a few times to what he studies and works on.


Q:        [1:37] Thank you so much.  And do you have any siblings?


A:        [1:39] I do.  I have two brothers, one younger, one older.


Q:        [1:45] And what do they do?


A:        [1:46] My older brother is a teacher in New Hampshire.  He teaches at a middle school, boys, boarding school.  And then my younger brother is still in college.  My older brother lives in New Hampshire during the school years and he's lived in Camden for the summers.


Q:        [2:02] Great.  And do you have any history of fishing in your family at all, this also might not necessarily look commercial fishing, anything that is recreationals – time on the water, stuff that.  


A:        [2:14] Yeah.  My dad's a big hobby fisherman, loves it a lot.  We used to go clamming when I was a kid.  But there's no history of commercial fishermen, fisherwomen in my family.  Very much hobby, seasonal.


Q:        [2:35] And you mentioned your position growing up as being at the intersection of these two rivers and being on the water.  Can you describe that for me?  What that was growing up?


A:        [2:45] Yeah.  I think it was just like, oh, the ocean is there.  And Freeport has a lot of fishermen there who work out at the harbor.  And we would spend summers on the canoe and the river, which is a saltwater, brackish river.  And yeah, there were – our neighbors who had an oyster farm at the end of our right where we looked out.  So when they were away, we'd keep an eye out for that.


But just you kind of knew what was going on.  We weren't necessarily – like I wasn't really interacting with it.  And I never really had the bug for fishing.
But I really liked being by the water.  


Q:        [3:39] Yeah, absolutely.  And I think you sort of touched on this.  But again, just for the sake of asking every question, do you have any family history and roles related to working on the water that may not necessarily be fishing?  Say bookkeeping, processing, marketing, work with bait or gear, anything that?


A:        [3:56] Yeah.  Not really.  I think I've been close to it, but not family involvement in it.


Q:        [4:12] Great.  Thanks so much.  And can you describe your educational background for me?  You mentioned you’re in grad school now.  So maybe up through the present day?


A:        [4:20] Yeah.  So I went to high school in Yarmouth.  And then went out to college in Washington State and studied politics there.  Kind of always have been working in food.  So after that was definitely interested in food systems and politics and kind of where that comes together.  And then in 2023, I started a graduate degree, a Masters in Analytics at Northeastern University, and still pursuing that part time.


Q:        [5:02] Great.  And are you married?


A:        [5:03] No.


Q:        [5:04] Do you have any children?


A:        [5:05] No.


Q:        [5:07] Great.  Thank you so much.  Now we're going to sort of transition into questions about your role in the fishing and aquaculture industry in Maine –


A:        [5:13] Yeah.


Q:        [5:16] – if we could start with just how you like to describe your role in the fishing and aquaculture industry in Maine.


A:        [5:22] I think I'm very inspired by it.  I used to run a catering company.  And during COVID, we started doing home delivery meals.  And we cook a lot, a lot of seafood because I was reading about how a lot of the seafood purveyors were kind of struggling because so many people eat seafood out at restaurants.  And they're not really comfortable cooking it in their homes.


So that was something I started to read about and realized I could do a tiny little thing with my small tiny business to buy more seafood and just support them.  And then the people who were supporting me would be eating more seafood.  


But I think as far as fisheries and aquaculture industry, I think I've always found it very inspiring, especially – what you think about these big issues of just climate change and food systems and population growth and these kind of really daunting issues that a lot of people – my age especially who are interested in politics or anything spend time thinking about.  And there's this point where I realize food and aquaculture were really a way to help with that.  They seemed such a small solution but that could be so much bigger of just like, oh, you have these zero input crops.  Wow, what if like, how unique is that to have really nutritious, incredible zero input crops that clean the environment around them?


That's so inspiring and makes you feel so hopeful to think about how you can support that.  So even commercial fishing, I mostly like, I'm interested in aquaculture from an intellectual point but and also business and also the main industry but just being really inspired by that and seeing that is just such a point of hope in this whole huge problem.  And I don't necessarily know it's something I love reading about and thinking about and talking to people about.  And I would love someday to be a lot more involved in that industry than I am.  I think there's just so many different ways to support it, whether that's from a food perspective or a consumer perspective or supporting the farm (inaudible) or supporting the industry.


Yeah, I think just being at a point of being really inspired by it and thinking it's just so cool if you look at these bigger problems.  But – yeah.


Q:        [8:04] Great.  And you mentioned your catering company that the seafood – I also know at the beginning you mentioned a startup.  Could you talk a little bit more about that?


A:        [8:11] Yeah, so there were I think – I guess starting from a few years ago realizing there were these really cool companies especially around Portland who were innovating in this space of aquaculture and really doing interesting things.


I was – just wanted to be involved in that and thought it was so cool.  So a year ago pretty much a friend had an idea for a seaweed farming device.  So we – so it's a device that goes in the water.  It's pretty much a smart buoy that moves up and down in the water.  So it collects data and has automation aspects and it's designed for – well potentially oysters.  We originally designed it for seaweed but realized the market wasn't necessarily there.  But still we're really inspired by that market and again, that's like, oh, what if we could make this industry more efficient and make just the idea of OK what technology innovations can you do to have farms produce more oysters per labor or more kelp per season.  There are these opportunities to just scale it that I think can happen through technology.


So we were kind of brainstorming on that and built a prototype and right now it's a little bit on the back burner but it's something we're all still working on part time.  So it's me and two other friends who are involved in that project.


Q:        [9:54] And can you describe to me just as much as you're comfortable with, maybe a little bit more about the device itself a little bit more about your process.  I’m just really interested to hear more about the whole thing.


A:        [10:05] Yeah.  So we started just researching technology in that space and what farming technology is out there.  We have one engineer, a data science and then me and I have professional experience in operations and food and different kind of business operations stuff.  So we were looking at the different mechanical solutions as well as data solutions.  So how can we understand more about the water that's being grown in and how can that inform farming.  So we integrated data collection as well as the mechanical aspects.


Q:        [10:52] Can you just describe what is your vision for the future of this, how do you hope this continues to evolve?


A:        [11:01] I'm not quite sure.  I think one of the bigger struggles is just understanding the market and of course if you're inventing something new, some kind of commercial support or commercial viability for that.  And I think that's something that's pretty tough for us right now.  But trying to figure out what that could look like, but also understanding that this industry is changing so quickly and there might be more investment for a product this in the future or openness for a product that's similar or does something similar in the future.  I think right now it's margins are just always so short that people are really hesitant to invest in new technology from a farming perspective.  


And so it's kind of a Catch 22 of like, oh, we could maybe you know get bigger margins from a labor perspective.  So decrease in labor costs.  But also you need this device is something this is not cheap and creating something this and iterating is not cheap.  So it would definitely trying to figure out if we're at the right timing in this industry.  But still have been, I think, one part of this whole process is talking to a lot of different farmers and going out on the boat with people and just understanding what their problems are.  And trying to talk to them about that and understand what the struggles are to start and operate and continue to operate and grow and scale a farm, whether that's seaweed or oysters.


And that's definitely informed a lot of where I'm going next.  But also has raised a lot of questions because it's not an easy industry and it's not easy to convince people that new technology is the way to go and investing a lot of money and risk in doing something a different way is the way to go.


Q:        [13:10] And I'm curious of you could talk a little bit more about things that can really improve  through talking to a lot of people in the industry or if there's anything that really sticks with you for those conversations. .


A:        [13:22] Yeah, I mean the cost of labor is so high.  And that's such a – that just restricts the ability to scale and grow more a lot and also decrease prices because you're just pretty much capped at how many oysters a laborer can make in a season.  So it's just there's just kind of this top ceiling and it's pretty much impossible to go above that.  So then it's hard to scale your farm or create more and I think just talking to a lot of people about that and understanding I knew the numbers behind of all of that and kind of the industry standard from reading.  But going out and talking to people about how that issue just keeps coming up in all these different ways is really hard and it's hard to see.


`        OK a broader scale how do we scale this industry if farmers have this much trouble scaling their own farms.  And even obviously I'm sure you've heard the lease issue of leases taking forever so then the industry is just it's just bottleneck kind of all the time.  So it would be really cool to see it grow faster.


Q:        [14:55] Yeah, and so you have this – you’ve been working on this start up for a year you said, right?


A:        [14:59] Yeah.


Q:        [15:00] And so how long ago, I'm curious, from the time you started integrating seafood into your catering situation all the way through now.  How many years have you sort of been working in these areas working with these topics and people working on water?


A:        [15:15] Yeah, after college I created a prototype app for connecting – I worked with a friend and some other people to create this prototype app connecting fish or fishermen – local seafood providers to local people who wanted it.  And we just never really got it all together but it was just I was reading again about how there's so much this mismatch of seafood consumption in the US where there's a we export so much seafood and then where we like, I don't remember the specific numbers, but I was just reading something even just in Rhode Island 5% of the seafood that's produced from Rhode Island gets consumed in state.  But 90% of the seafood that gets consumed in state is imported so there's just this backwards in the whole seafood industry.  


We consume pretty much all imported seafood and then we export all of the seafood that's produced in the US so it's just this issue of consumption and knowledge and access and accessible information on seafood.  So I was trying to make something that could connect fishermen and seafood purveyors to the people who wanted that and even information and recipes about what to do with you know winter seafood crops which are much less popular in the US, they're not your typical salmon or haddock fillet.


So just teaching and trying to understand how to get that information out there and it never totally worked out that project but it was – it's something I still think about and wonder if it could be done in a different way or if it is maybe a legislative issue of how do we inform this stuff on a state level.  Maybe a government thing could take care of some of that information.  And just be better about providing that information.


        I think you're on mute sorry.


Q:        [17:37] Sorry.  So how many years ago was that?


A:        [17:41] Sorry.  


Q:        [17:42] (multiple conversations; inaudible) really engaged in so many different ways and I guess I just feel really impressed by the amount of different ways you're sort of engaging and I'm wondering how long over.  


A:        [17:53] So that was 2020 that that project and so yeah I guess four years.


Q:        [18:04] Thank you so much.  I'm curious with engaging in seafood and with sea farming and all these different perspectives.  Is there any are there any reflections that really stick out to you, things that you from doing all these things really feel like, prescient or compelling?


A:        [18:22] Yeah, I think the options for technology innovation in this space just – they should be more and better funded.  There are more blue economy kind of startup funds or incubators or things that coming into this space.  A lot of them are populated by finfish farming technology and I think moving some of that more towards aquaculture would be really interesting to see or some fisheries – and I guess some of that technology is going towards how can we make thin fin-farming more sustainable and better practices.


But there's just not as much for aquaculture and that's because this industry is not as lucrative as like, I don't know eel farming, or salmon farming.  But it's not as lucrative yet and I think there's an opportunity for that investment and from that startups – startup funds incubators that early – that money to early access startups and early on innovation is just really important to expand to support that technology moving forward in this industry.


Q:        [19:47] Great thank you so what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask you a few questions that are more specific about your experience.  I always forget that the Zoom times you for these meetings so when we run out of time I'll just restart the meeting to keep the voice notes running.  I think that these questions will align perfectly with the end of time.


A:        [20:05] Perfect.  


Q:        [20:06] We’ll see.  These are sort of shorter yes, no kind of questions.  Do you hold any commercial licenses?  Those could be fishing or (inaudible) and if so could you describe those to me?


A:        [20:19] No.


Q:        [20:22] Thank you.  Do you own a boat?


A:        [20:23] I do not.


Q:        [20:28] And do you have any experience in the industry beyond fishing or harvesting directly?  I'm going to give you some specifics to sort of bounce off of, the first of which are bookkeeping, bait or gear preparation?


A:        [20:38] No.


Q:        [20:43] What about those post-harvest processing, marketing or trade?


A:        [20:46] I guess some marketing.


Q:        [20:51] Could you speak a little bit more about that?


A:        [20:53] Can you go back to the questions specifically?


Q:        [20:56] Yeah, sure.  Just any experience that you have with marketing and you've touched on it already a lot.


A:        [21:03] Yeah.


Q:        [21:04] So just if there's anything that you feel you want to add or anything that you haven’t touched on.


A:        [21:11] Yeah.  I think just learning about some of the information channels and things that for aquaculture products and seafood in general.  But just learning how to broadcast that information better and get it to the right audiences and see where people are getting their information and try to get better information to those channels,  whether that's supermarkets, digital media, all over the place.  But just understanding how people are getting educated on the consumption of these products.


Q:        [21:43] Great.  Thank you.  And what about any experience in factories or research and development?


A:        [21:48] No.


Q:        [21:52] What about and again, you’ve touched on this already.  So of there's anything that you feel compelled to add – any experience or reflections from work in food prep consumer interface, seafood, that kind of stuff.


A:        [22:02] Yeah.  I guess food prep and consumer interface is kind of where I’ve spend more time.  But just yeah, understanding consumer behavior and again, where people get their information and where mainstream kind of consumers are getting their information on seafood in general.  And seeing how you can put information that's informing them about local and seasonal seafood products, and also dispelling some of the myths about negative qualities of consuming seafood.


Q:        [22:47] Great.  And the last one, what about advocacy or any community based organization related to fisheries or aquaculture?


A:        [22:54] Not specifically.


Q:        [22:58] Great.  Thank you.  And so then I think the last question I’ll ask before just transition to the Zoom meeting and maybe you'll need more time – but do you feel or how do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing and aquaculture.


A:        [23:12] Yeah.  I think I am really curious about this industry probably because I like, I mean I grew up in Maine and I have friends who work in aquaculture on oyster farms, harvesting kelp, lobstering etc.  And trying to better understand what that – how those can be supported.  And I think seeing the way that environment – environmental changes has shifted this industry in the last five years pretty much since I've been an adult and seeing how different it is from when I was a kid.  And understanding how that can be better supported and what are these changes that are happening environmentally also economically and even the perception of this industry.  


And then I think learning more about seafood consumption food and restaurant eating out as well as seafood purchasing and all of those consumer behaviors.  Definitely has all of those together informs what I'm interested in in this industry and where I see some of the big pain points with it growing and supporting this industry.  


Q:        [24:43] Thank you and do you feel your identity from a gender perspective influences your work at all?


A:        [24:48] I think there's – I don't know – I feel I've never worked on a farm and I've worked briefly on a lobster boat but not any meaningful experience with that but I know that there's a lot of just kind of old fashion kind of sexist behaviors in those communities.  And I think there's also – I've seen it in a different way of just this resistance to change and resistance to technology or shifting maybe your business model if lobster you don't get to make the money you used to lobstering and how can you maybe shift your business model and include some alternative revenue streams.  And seeing how sometimes people are really resistant towards that because it seems a change that they don't really want and I think just that kind of trend.  I can see from a little bit of outside perspective which I don't know that's definitely related to my identity.  Oops.


(long pause)


A:        [26:30] There we go.  


Q:        [26:31] I'm so sorry I didn’t know it would just cut off.  I thought it gave you a little bit of time.


A:        [26:35] I see the timer in the corner.  I think just that being a little bit of an outsider gives me that for its bird eye’s perspective a little bit more and you can see, oh this behavior, this resistance – oh there's some logic up behind it but there's definitely a lot of emotion or things to saying no about this technology or not even being interested in these certain changes or talking to someone about these changes.  And I've gotten that with just even talking about the role of technology in oyster farming in general to people and I'll try and breach it as a very general thing just to talk with someone to get into what they're thinking.  And people can be there's not – I wouldn’t say it's the majority but there's definitely some old fashioned farmers who can be pretty resistant to that.


Q:        [27:37] And do you feel there's a gendered element to that response at all?


A:        [27:41] Potentially?  I think there's also a potentially an age and I probably don't know as much of the industry is maybe someone who's been farming for 50 or 60 years but that's why I'm trying to ask them questions.  And so I think some of that just a little bit of maybe some resentment or things that and it could have to do with so many different factors all put together.  


Q:        [28:12] Absolutely thank you so much.  I'm going to sort of transition into questions about environmental change– these just could be things that you’ve either directly observed through engaging in all these different ways of seafood, or maybe their things that you are a built experience from all of the different things that you've done and talking to people.  Just however you feel interpreting the questions and if you don't feel you have an answer that's also totally OK.  Just whatever feels right.  So just starting can you describe any changes in the environment that you noticed or have affected you directly?


A:        [28:43] Yeah, I mean I think the flooding and erosion and changing risk to harbors at this point it's going to be a yearly issue in Maine I think, and it's just going to become worse and worse.  So that just threatens equipment it threatens farming operations and all of those issues which – yeah threatens growth in a lot of different ways.


Q:        [29:18] Thank you, you just tell me a little bit more about effects you're seeing of that? I know we just had those terrible stories in January I'm just curious if that impacted your work at all or just anything else you might want to describe. 


A:        [29:29] Yeah it definitely did I think because people lost equipment or shit was damaged, oh sorry, I don't know if I can swear.  Or equipment was damaged and docks are damaged and things that so it gives a lot of more hesitancy to invest in things that could have issues.  And so I think that was something that was we're trying to create something new and a lot of people were saying OK but can it stand up in a storm?  Or OK, maybe you could help with one idea – and something we have partially implemented was a mechanical aspect to sink a farm to the bottom to protect it from potential storm damage.


And that's something that appeals to a lot of people because they're seeing that is yeah you could just lose all your crops in a night because it's sitting on the surface and you have a big storm come through, and you're no longer as protected as you used to be, being inland of a bunch of islands – so you're no longer protected the inside of Casco Bay or areas that you used to be when there weren't as many of these huge storms and huge floods.


Q:        [30:50] And so you mentioned sort of trying to create the ability of the farm to sink and curious if there are any other things you're sort of trying especially with your kind of experimental startup (multiple conversations; inaudible).


A:        [30:59] Yeah.


Q:        [31:01]  – with these environmental changes combined.


A:        [31:03] Yeah.  I think we were really inspired by offshore farming technology which is really expensive and huge for say kelp farms and it's not necessarily accessible for someone with a little boat and it doesn't have acreage like 50 miles out.  But a huge benefit of that is that they're sunk down so they're submerged more and so if you have a deeper water even inland it might protect it from islands.  There is an opportunity to sink that down and so I think that was kind of one of the main ones as far as storm damage.  But yeah, we were really inspired by offshore farms because that's a huge benefit of them is you can move it up and down a bunch and you're not getting the same damage potentially but the equipment is huge.  So we're just kind of experimenting if you could scale that down or make some of that more accessible to someone with less massive equipment.


Q:        [32:11] And can I ask maybe about your results or your experience as much as you’re comfortable sharing?


A:        [32:17] Yeah.                                                        


Q:        [32:18] What did you find in that process? 


A:        [32:19] We're working so we're working on that mechanically to hold it at a sinking level.  We have a pretty solid lifting capacity lifting up and down some lines in the water – so two buoys and it could lift it down or up.


So yeah so we have that kind of prototyped but it's – we're working on getting it better intergratable (sic) to existing farming equipment.  (inaudible).  Sorry.


Q:        [32:56] Thank you.  I'm curious what do you think has made it possible – the way this question is worded is sort of a question about resources.  What has made up possible for you to do that experimentation and have all your experience and startup?  I'm curious if there's anything else that you really think you're drawing on as you're thinking about these changes and adopting to them.


A:        [33:15] Yeah, so as far as doing this startup there's me and one of my friends are both grad students at Northeastern which has been huge because we get a lot of resources accessible to us through that, through Northeastern in Boston and in Maine.  So that gave us product development resources.  We had a team of engineers working for us for eight months.  So graduate school engineers who had pretty much a project and their project was our device so we got to work with them and collaborate with them which gave us access to labs and they get a benefit of learning and creating this thing and then we get the end product.  


As well as we've worked with GMRI and we were in one of their early incubators in Portland and then have received some support from the Roux Institute because we're both students there.  So they're trying to understand how they can support student entrepreneurship and we're kind of a guinea pig for them.  So I think being able to – there's no way with this would have been possible without those connections and being in school at the same time.  But – yeah.


Q:        [34:41] Yeah great, and I'm curious as you look towards the future sort of thinking about your connections your experiences the things you're observing – are there things you really want to keep experimenting with, really want to keep trying, new directions you want to go?


A:        [34:53] Yeah.  I think I'm still really curious about the food side of this industry and how I think some of the companies who are doing aquaculture food products are really doing interesting things and I'm curious to see where that goes.  I think going back to the information issues with this, I think that's a huge issue that I'm not seeing super well addressed here.  But it'll be interesting to see if that can be improved.  I know I've met with some of the people at the WWF, World Wildlife Fund and they're doing stuff in Maine on messaging for aquaculture and just messaging campaigns which I think is really cool and very needed.  So they're working on curriculum and younger schools so that people can just understand this industry, young Mainers can see what's going on and understand it because they're learning about global warming and all of these different environmental changes and learning how this industry fits into that.  


So I think those information marketing campaigns kind of and just that information sharing from the consumer perspective and the farmer’s perspective and the public knowledge perspective I guess.  I think that's just really important and going to be a huge thing that I would love to be more involved with and especially this product even – and this project has really opened my eyes to how much that's needed too on a mainstream level.


Q:        [36:46] Great thank you and that's transitions neatly into my next question for you which is as you look towards the future what do you think is the biggest environmental concern for Mainers and especially with your hands and this is the way to have maybe a different way to frame it – thinking about information just what do you think is really important for policymakers or for the general public to know, as sort of we look towards the future with Maine’s green industry.


A:        [37:10] Yeah, I think supporting these products and right now there's often perceived as luxury products from the consumer perspective and I think that can be something that can be changed and worked on.  So it's not even the cost may not even be that high but the perception is just that they're luxury, special products, so local seafood or local aquaculture products are just perceived as special and luxury and I think that comes off of – I mean I don't know what it comes off of.  Maybe it's related to lobster being kind of a luxury product but I think that perception and we are consuming a lot of seafood.  But a lot of it's just imported and all of these other things.  Why not more eat more local seafood or be have that be more accessible and more understood and for the farmers and for consumers that just can have a huge benefit.


Q:        [38:23] I'm going to ask you a few questions about climate resilience.  Have you ever participated in my climate relating workshops or adaptation trainings, anything that in the fishing industry?


A:        [38:33] Not formally but I think – I guess I'd talk to people and work with some people who are very much at the forefront of that.


Q:        [38:47] Great, and you mentioned a lot of different ways that you can feel this can be built and I'm curious if there's anything else you want to add about the ways that the fishing or aquaculture industry could build resilience.
 
A:        [38:58] Yeah.  I think – I don't know I'm not the best person to say on the technical perspectives of how do we make the fishing stuff – the fishing economy is and harbor fronts physically more resilient, which is a big issue.  But I think – I've said supporting these ventures whether it's someone trying to scale their farm, someone trying to try a new thing on their farm and just making that funding more accessible.  Or whether it's someone from the outside trying to create something to try on a farm or any way that people are trying to innovate and scale and change and adapt having that funding accessible and increasing that funding is really important.


Q:        [40:03] Great.  Thank you.  Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes you've seen in your time doing this work?


A:        [40:09] I think people are – it's a really adaptable, generally a really adaptable demographic who are running these companies and these farms.  People are really molding their own equipment.  They're making up solutions to solve their problems.  And I think that's something that lends itself really well to adaptation and resilience.  I've just seen some really creative solutions when you go in the water with people and they're like, oh we had this issue for the last few years, but so I made this new way of helping to flip the oyster baskets or helping to make things the right buoyancy or whatever.  And they're making their own solutions in their backyard, which is just if you look at comparable industries I'm sure there's overlap but it's something that's really unique and people are just really crafty and adaptable.


Q:        [41:17] Great.  Thank you and I'm curious as you look towards the future, what is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine’s fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [41:25] Yeah.  I think having, I mean I think making it more accessible to start and scale a farm and making it easier for people to start and scale a farm.  And that comes with  – that's a lot of different things whether that's leasing issues information channels which there are – there's a lot better information out there about farming and regulation and things.  GMRI is doing a lot of really good work with that but also just scaling a farm and that just being able to start and scale if you want to start a farm it should not have to take a lot of upfront cost and knowledge and all of this.  I think it should be more accessible.


Q:        [42:15] Great.  Thank you and have you noticed any change in women's presence participation or status in aquaculture or fisheries over your time working with seafood?


A:        [42:26] I think especially in oyster farming there's a lot of women who are leading the charge and trying new things and marketing themselves really well and creating really solid markets and consumer bases that are really loyal and just making it really female forward.  And I think you're just seeing that especially in oyster farming it's so awesome to see these really cool solutions come out of female owned and operated farms.


Q:        [43:06] Great and then my last question for you is – because I forgot to ask it earlier, where are you currently based when you're not in Carrabassett? (sp?)


A:        [43:15] I'm in Portland right now.  


Q:        [43:17] Great, thank you and are there any other things you want to say to me before we end of interview?


A:        [43:22] I don't think so.  I covered a lot.


Q:        [43:26] Great well thank you so much this was so wonderful.  In a second I’ll go ahead and the Zoom.  If you could send me both the voice memo and the release form that would be awesome.  And I’ll keeping you in the loop with everything related to this project and thank you so much again for being so generous with your time especially while you're away.


A:        [43:45] Yeah of course.  Thank you so much.  It was great to chat.


Q:        [43:47] Of course.  Have a great rest of your day Claire.  Please go free to email me if you have absolutely any questions.


A:        [43:52] I will.  Perfect.


 END OF FILE"
"21","F:        [0:00] If you need to hop up, just hop up.  We’ll pause.  


A:        [0:04] OK.


F:        [0:05] Whenever you’re back, you’re back.


Q:        [0:06] Yeah, just let us know.  I'm going to try to move through this quickly.  I know you're very busy.


A:        [0:09] Sure.


Q:        [0:10] Whatever feels good.  


A:        [0:11] OK.  


Q:        [0:12] We just like to start with, how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:15] Yeah, I'm Jillian Robillard, Owner of Southern Maine Crabs in Kittery, Maine.


Q:        [0:20] Great.  Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:23] Yeah.  I grew up in Eliot.  My dad was a commercial fisherman, dragging and gillnetting for most of my childhood.  He got out of that for a little bit just because of the quota cutbacks on fish, over regulation by the government.  And then from there, a few years later, he ended up getting into lobstering.  Worked on the boat a couple times and just decided to open up a crab market.


Q:        [0:46] Cool.


A:        [0:47] Yeah.  


Q:        [0:48] You mentioned your dad.  What does your mom do?


A:        [0:51] My mom was a stay-at-home mom, but she did all the books for my dad.  Of course, managed my brother and I, bringing us to sports and stuff growing up.  She helped me out with the business.  She does all the errands for me, goes to the bank, the post office – everything.  


Q:        [1:06] That's awesome.  You have a brother.  Do you have any other siblings?


A:        [1:09] Just an older brother.


Q:        [1:11] Just an older brother.  Do you have any history of fishing in your family beyond your dad?  


A:        [1:16] No, my dad was the one that started it.


Q:        [1:17] Interesting.  And is his family from Maine?  


A:        [1:20] Yes.  From the York area – York, South Berwick.  


Q:        [1:25] Nice.  And what does your brother do?


A:        [1:26] He works on a lobster boat.


Q:        [1:29] Cool.  It just keeps going.  


A:        [1:30] Yeah.


Q:        [1:31] Great.  You mentioned your mom's history with bookkeeping.  Do you have any other family history with bookkeeping, processing, marketing, bait, gear, food service with seafood?


A:        [1:42] Not much, no.  Most of my family – we're all kind of entrepreneurs.  We've all done our own things, but it's been completely separate industries.  


Q:        [1:50] Cool.  And are you married?  


A:        [1:52] No.  


Q:        [1:53] Do you have any children?  


A:        [1:54] No.


Q:        [1:55] All right, great.  Now, we're going to sort of transition towards questions about your role and what you do right now.  I'm curious if you could just describe to me your role in the fishing and aquaculture industry in Maine.


A:        [2:06] Basically, what I do is I buy crabs and lobsters directly off the harvesters.  So, the lobstermen.  The crabs – it's all bycatch in the lobster gear.  I take that.  I've got holding tanks.  We process them.  We pack them and ship them live.  We sell them retail.  We have a few different restaurants that we sell to.  We do process them and sell the meat.  We sell the claws, both for lobsters and crabs, and yeah, just distribute it locally, really.


Q:        [2:37] Cool.  How long have you been doing this?


A:        [2:41] I've been in business for a little over six years now.  I've had the facility for about three years and the retail market for a year.  


Q:        [2:48] Cool.  What inspired you to start doing this?  


A:        [2:53] Yeah.  I was out lobstering with my dad one day, and we're catching quite a few crabs.  From there, we took a few home for dinner, and he was telling me that they were really a good seafood.  He didn't really know why that there wasn't a local market.  I started looking into it, and I ended up buying a truck and starting to buy his crabs.  And then it just grew from there, buying other people's crabs and buying their lobsters.  It’s kind of unraveled.


Q:        [3:20] Cool.  Were you often out on the boat with your dad?  Did you go fishing with him often?


A:        [3:25] I tried to as much as I could.  Yeah.


Q:        [3:28] Nice.  Can you talk a little bit about what made you want to continue working in the fisheries in that sector?


A:        [3:39] I had always said growing up, I wanted to be a marine biologist.  And then through my father's connections and stuff, he was able to get me sort of an internship almost when I was either in middle school or high school, working at the UNH lab in Durham.  From there, we did a lot of lab research and stuff.  I just decided that marine biology – sitting in a lab – wasn't really for me.  I went into college, and I declared a marine bio major, and still just didn't seem like it was the right fit.  And then one thing led to another, and the University of New England started offering a marine entrepreneurship program.  I ended up claiming that as my major and ran with that.  I think I claimed that at the end of sophomore year, and then halfway through sophomore year, I'd started this business, so it just fit in with what I was doing.  


Q:        [4:35] Wow.  You were doing this and college at the same time?  


A:        [4:38] Yeah.


Q:        [4:40] Wow.  How did you find balancing those things?


A:        [4:42] Freshman year, I didn't have the business.  I worked for someone else, but I commuted back into – back and forth from Biddeford every day.  Sophomore year, once I had the business, I was living on campus, so I'd go to class Monday through Thursday.  I made my schedule so that I had no classes Friday.  Thursday night, I'd drive home, get in my box truck, go and get all the crabs, and then, Thursday through Sunday, sell everything I could.  Then, Sunday night, I would write checks, put it on the fisherman's boats, and then head back up to school.  


Q:        [5:12] Wow.  How do you feel like – or do you feel like doing those things simultaneously informs your business?


A:        [5:20] Definitely.  Yeah, definitely.  Being in college and stuff and not full-time working, it let me learn things through school, but also then directly implement them with the business at the same time.


Q:        [5:34] Yeah.  Were you learning things, then literally directly implementing them as you were learning them?


A:        [5:37] Yeah.  


Q:        [5:38] Can you talk a little bit about what that was like?


A:        [5:41] Yeah.  I think the biggest thing for me was – I was taking accounting classes, so we'd have worksheets and stuff.  Instead of doing the numbers on the worksheets, I’d just take the numbers off my own books and put it in there.  I had a little bit better of an understanding of what was going on financially with the business and stuff like that, as well as business management classes and legalities behind – how to pay the taxes and stuff like that.


Q:        [6:09] That's cool.  You mentioned your mom bookkeeping.  Was that something that you ever helped her with?  Or did that experience sort of inform this in any way?  


A:        [6:17] I haven't helped her, but she's definitely helped me with some things.  We regularly meet with my accountant and stuff.  Anything I don't understand, I just hand off to her, and she figures it out and explains it to me.  We work together that way.


Q:        [6:33] Cool.  Can you talk a little bit more about your business model, I guess?  I'm curious how you get in contact with fishermen, how you get the crabs, what it looks like once they're here.


A:        [6:42] Yeah.  One of my biggest things with the business, because there is so much competition in the area, has always been I don't want to be a person that has to solicit boats.  If I'm doing my job the right way and paying them a fair price and offering a good service, I shouldn't have to do that.  I would never walk up to the captain of a boat that sells their product to another company and say, “Hey, sell me your product.”  I let them come to me first.  I think that's gained a lot of respect.  I'm also very transparent with my fishermen.  I tell them what the price is that day and I stick to that even if the price drops by the end of the day.  I don't do that to them.  Then, help them out.  If they're in a hard time, if they're getting towed in or something, they can't get in until eight o'clock at night – wait around for them.  Just different things like that – having good quality bait – really goes a long way 


Q:        [7:35] Cool.  So, once the fishermen bring the crabs here – do they bring them here?


A:        [7:40] Some bring them here.  Some we drive down to the dock and pick up.  We put their name on the crate.  We float it into the tank.  We don't touch it that day.  The next morning, we come in, and we start going through them.  We pull out anything that would be dead.  We get their live weight off of that.  We log all of that down, and then from there, we just start going through our orders for the day, whether it's wholesale orders, restaurant orders, shipping orders, whatever it is.  


Q:        [8:10] What do you see most?  Do you see mostly wholesale, mostly restaurant?


A:        [8:13] In the wintertime, it's definitely mostly wholesale.  In the summertime, I'd say we definitely do more volume wholesale, but we have quite a few restaurant accounts, smaller accounts, and stuff like that that really helps out.  I'd say summertime is probably 50/50 timewise, but definitely more volume goes wholesale.


Q:        [8:32] Cool.  Do you have a sense of what the crabs are being used for once you sell them?


A:        [8:37] Yeah.  So, if a restaurant takes them, usually they boil or steam them, put them on a plate for someone to eat.  If they go off to a larger company, sometimes that goes out to a grocery store chain.  Other times, they'll process it, and they'll pick the crab for meat, or they'll sell Empress claws or something like that.


Q:        [8:57] Cool.  You mentioned good bait.  Can you talk a little bit more about that or what you meant?


A:        [9:03] Yeah.  So, sometimes cheaper isn’t always better.  Having a good quality bait – if you're getting fresh stuff, it's in a brine.  It's salted well.  The temperature – it's kept pretty cold, pretty much frozen at that point.  Decent prices.  Someone doesn't want to go out and pay $300 for a drum of rotten fish.  A lot of what I do is importing frozen bait.  That way, I know the quality is good.  I'll stand behind it.  That way, they have it, and it's frozen, and it's there's no way it can be rotten.  We don't have to salt it.  There's no brine to it.  It's a lot less messy.  


Q:        [9:45] Sure.  In terms of bait, what does that element look like?  How do you – do people come to you to buy it?


A:        [9:54] Yeah.  Typically, when a boat texts me that they're going to be in, say, at three o'clock in the afternoon, they'll say, “Hey, can you bring me three drums of redheads?”  We'll drum up the redheads, we'll throw it on the truck, and bring it down to them.  We do have some people that don't sell us product, but they do buy our bait, so usually they come here and they pick it up.  We just load it onto their truck for them.


Q:        [10:16] Nice.  Just thinking about all the different experiences that could be a part of the fishing sector.  You've mentioned bookkeeping.  You've mentioned bait.  Do you have any gear-related experience or any element of that in the business? 


A:        [10:30] I try to stay away from the gear side of things.  There's a lot to it.  Leave that to the fisherman, really.


Q:        [10:38] Yeah, absolutely.  In terms of processing that happens here, can you talk a little bit more about that?


A:        [10:45] Yeah.  Most of the processing that we do is going to be for restaurant accounts and for the retail market.  I'd say, right now we've been processing quite a bit of lobster, lobster meat for the restaurant – summertime, tourists coming in and stuff.  Then I'm hoping this summer to get some sort of a second shift going to be able to process crabs during the day and then lobsters at night and just kind of keep rolling with that.


Q:        [11:09] Nice.  With the processing, what has it been like to build out the infrastructure and employees to be able to do that?


A:        [11:20] Yeah, it's difficult because once I got the facility, of course, we went into COVID.  It was pretty hard at that point, and then it's been hard since then to rebound and be able to find good employees and stuff, especially in this industry.  It’s backbreaking work, a lot of physical labor and stuff.  It’s trying to find that happy medium of finding good employees that will have your back, but at the same time treating them right.  


Q:        [11:49] Yeah, absolutely.  Can you talk a little bit about your experience, or, I guess, maybe thoughts about marketing, especially with green crabs in particular?


A:        [12:00] Yeah.  As far as marketing goes, I think our biggest outlet really has been Facebook, sharing to different groups.  That gained traction during COVID.  And it's really been, I think, educating the public that way, telling them this is what we vocally have, and this is what you would get elsewhere – imported products, really.  What was the rest of that question?  


Q:        [12:27] I don't know.  How do you feel like that's gone, educating people about green crabs?


A:        [12:34] Yeah, I think it's gone well.  I know there's quite a few people up in York that take the green crabs and they sell them to restaurants and stuff.  I think the hard part is getting people to initially try them, and then from there, it's kind of finding different things to do with them – soups and bisques and stuff like that.


Q:        [12:51] Do you have any opinions about what's like a successful first try for people?  


A:        [12:55] Really just getting someone to try it, whether they like it or not.  Getting past that initial like, “OK, I'm going to eat this thing.”


Q:        [13:05] Yeah, absolutely.  I'm curious.  Do you have any experience in advocacy or any community-based organization related to fisheries, green crabs, processing?


A:        [13:14] I do a lot in Portsmouth with infrastructure and stuff, trying to help the fishermen down there get better infrastructure – working hoists, better docks, and stuff like that.  I did an internship in college with Gabby Bradt on green crabs, trying to get them to molt in a lab setting.  That way, you could then sell them to restaurants as a molted crab and stuff like that.  


Q:        [13:38] Can you talk a little bit more about that experience?  


A:        [13:40] I'm not sure if I'm allowed to. (laughter)


Q:        [13:43] OK.  That’s totally fair.  Yeah.


F:        [13:45] Can I ask a question?  Most of the fishermen you buy from – are they in Portsmouth?  I'm just curious.  We're in Downeast Maine, and we haven't talked to anyone who's this close down to the border with New Hampshire.  I'm just curious.  Are most of the fishermen in New Hampshire?  Is a little bit Maine and New Hampshire.  Which ports are you servicing?  


A:        [14:03] Yep.  We have boats that land every day in York, Kittery, Portsmouth, Rye, and Hampton, and then a few times a week, I have a few different wharves up in Portland, where those boats will sell me their crabs.


Q:        [14:16] Is that a lot of logistics work to figure out how to move all that around?


A:        [14:21] Definitely, yes.  Yep.  


Q:        [14:24] This might be an impossible question to answer, but to your best, or if you can provide me with a couple different examples, what does an average day of work look like for you?


A:        [14:34] Yeah, it definitely – it varies day by day, but usually what happens is, we come in in the morning, we go through all of our product.  From there, I write down the orders.  They'll pack out the orders, and then I usually have one or two people out on restaurant deliveries.  In the meantime, if we have to process lobster meat that day for restaurants, fire up cookers, and we'll start processing.  Usually, I hop back there and start picking that.  Then, come about 11:00 o'clock in the morning or so is when boats start calling me, saying that they need bait, they need to get picked up and stuff.  Usually, we’ll take a quick lunch break, and then we'll pretty much all hop in a vehicle and start driving around to the different docks and meeting fishermen at their pickup times.  From there, we come back.  We put the crates in the tanks, we label them and stuff, and then just continue on with the day.


Q:        [15:29] Wow.  But then, do you have days like this often where you're working in other parts of the of the business?  


A:        [15:37] Definitely, yeah.  Every day, I'm usually more so helping them grade through lobsters, go through crabs – stuff like that.  Retail, we do Friday through Sunday.  If someone calls out, usually I have to fill in for that, which takes me off the road for the day.  I'll definitely be at the shop until about six o'clock tonight when we close, and then probably hopefully get some of my other stuff done.


Q:        [16:01] What are your hours for the retail?


A:        [16:04] Friday, Saturday, we are 10:00 to 6:00.  And then Sunday, we're 10:00 to 5:00.


Q:        [16:08] When you're not working in this retail capacity, how long are you here during the day?  How long is your workday usually?


A:        [16:16] Yeah.  If we’re just a regular week, not slammed busy, I try to start around 6:00, 7:00 o'clock in the morning.  If we are slammed busy, it's usually about 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning.  And then, last boat typically hits the dock at 5:30, 6:00 o'clock.  So puts us out of here right around 7:00.  And then the nights that I have to be on the road at night, sometimes I don't get back until like 11:00 o'clock, midnight.  


Q:        [16:41] Wow, that's amazing.  


A:        [16:43] Yeah, it's a lot of work. (laughter)


Q:        [16:44] Yeah.  What is your experience of that?


A:        [16:46] It's fun.  You like your job, you never work a day in your life.  It's what they say. Vast majority of the days, it doesn't feel like a job.  Sometimes, it does get to you, but most of the time, it's really nice to be doing what I do.  I think the best part is talking to the fishermen and spending some time with them, hearing their stories.


Q:        [17:07] Yeah.  Can you talk a little bit about what that's like?  


A:        [17:09] Yeah.  So, kind of lucky that we have still a few older fishermen kicking around.  You learn how things used to be done versus how they're done now.  You can pick their brains on different things.  It's nice.  You can contact them for different connections and whatnot and just see what they know.


Q:        [17:29] Yeah.  Have there been any really big takeaways from those conversations with older fishermen?


A:        [17:35] Definitely, yeah.  I've learned a lot of who to do business with, and who to watch out for, and different things like that, as well as a lot of what didn't used to work for them – different bait, stuff like that.


Q:        [17:51] Yeah.  And do you hold any commercial fishing licenses yourself?


A:        [17:55] I don't.


Q:        [17:57] You don’t.  I'm curious, how do you think your background coming from a fishing family and with that experience with your mom being able to help you –?  How do you think that impacts your work?


A:        [18:12] Yeah.  I think given what my dad's done and stuff, he's a very well-known fisherman.  He's done really well for himself, but he's done it respectfully.  He's always had respect for his elders and stuff, so that's definitely helped.  But in the same sense of things, fishermen don't really trust anything.   You have to gain your own trust and make your own way that way, which has been nice.


Q:        [18:35] Yeah.  What has that experience been like for you?  


A:        [18:38] In the beginning, it was difficult.  I had a few comments of – “If I sell you my crabs, is your check going to cash?”  A few different things.  I think that was a little bit to do with age and stuff, being so young.  But it's worked out.  I hate to say it, but I have to turn away business every day because we're just so busy now.  


Q:        [19:02] Yeah, that’s awesome.


A:        [19:03] Yeah.  


Q:        [19:04] I'm curious, do you think your identity as a woman has had – can you talk about the impact that might have had with those things?


A:        [19:10] Yeah, there's definitely been some negative comments over the years.  But for the most part, anyone that’s seen me work and stuff like that, it's gained a little bit more respect from them, picking up crates just like the guys do and throwing them around and whatnot.


F:        [19:25] Can I ask, too – you're young, especially if you started this business six years ago – you alluded to it a little bit in answering a little bit earlier, but I just wonder about that intersection of being also a younger woman in the industry that probably trends male and older, if you feel like that has had an impact at all?


A:        [19:43] Yeah, I think in the beginning, a lot of them were skeptical of myself and what I'm doing and stuff, kind of, “Who is this type of person?” type of thing.  Then, I think in the end, once I earned that respect, it's gone a long way.  They call me and check in with me every day now just to have conversations and stuff, and it's been nice.


Q:        [20:03] That's fantastic.  I'm curious.  Do you think your role with the business, especially with you being so busy – does that impact any family or caregiving responsibilities you might have?


A:        [20:14] It makes it hard, I guess, to schedule anything with the family.  I've told them I'm on a 10-minute basis, so 10 minutes from now, I have no clue what I'm going to be doing.  But they all understand, and they know where to find me at the shop, or just to give me a shout, or something like that.  They see that I work hard, that I'm busy, and my life is kind of run by fishermen at this point, so they work with it.


Q:        [20:42] And how nice that you have a relationship where they also help you a lot.  It seems like you guys really are able to interact in that way.  


A:        [20:47] Definitely, yeah.


Q:        [20:50] So then I want to shift into questions about environment and changes you might be noticing since you interact with so much product.  Have you noticed any changes in the marine environment in your time with this business?


A:        [21:03] Yeah, definitely.  When I was first starting out, we didn't see as many soft-shell lobsters as we do now.  There was more of a split season.  Once you get into the winter months, you'd see pretty much all hard shells.  You just don't see that now.  All winter long, you'll get crabs that are shedding, you'll get lobsters that are shedding.  And I think we'll just see that more and more.  There's been a lot of crabs around the last few years.  I'm not sure if that's due to water temperatures or what that is due to.  Definitely been a lot more crabs.  We've seen quite a few more blue crabs coming up from the south up in the estuaries and the bays and stuff like that.  


Q:        [21:41] Wow.  When did you start seeing the blue crabs?


A:        [21:44] I think it's been probably about four or five years now people have been seeing them.  Not really in any volume.  They'll catch one here or there, but they're definitely starting to come up here.


Q:        [21:54] You do feel like the green crabs are increasing as well.


A:        [21:57] Definitely.


Q:        [21:59] Definitely.  How are those changes impacting your business and the work you do?


A:        [22:04] The demand for them hasn't necessarily grown, but the supply of them has.  We're starting to see a little bit lower prices.  The competition in the market's increased.  More people have gotten into it.  So, constantly going back and forth on prices with wholesalers and whatnot.


Q:        [22:24] And is there anything – have you tried anything to account for that or adapt to it?


A:        [22:29] Just rolling with the punches and playing it by ear and seeing what you can do, who you can work with, and stuff.


Q:        [22:37] What does it look like to do that?  In your mind, what are all the things you're juggling as you're looking at that?


A:        [22:44] Yeah.  I think one of the biggest is logistics, making sure you have enough people, enough trucks on the road and stuff like that, and trying to team up with other businesses.  So, if I've got a truck that I have to send down to Boston, call a few friends and say, “Hey, do you have anything that you need to go down to Boston?  Throw it on my truck.”  Kind of all help each other out that way, that way at least some of us are freed up and whatnot.


Q:        [23:06] Do you find that there's a lot of that kind of collaboration?  


A:        [23:10] Not typically.  No, no.  You have to be pretty trusting of someone to be able to work with them like that.


Q:        [23:18] Yeah, absolutely.  I'm curious, also with those changes, have you made any changes with where you process, how you process, the way you source – anything like that? 


A:        [23:27] I used to go as far north as Cushing, Spruce Head, and stuff like that to get crabs.  Now, because the supply has picked up locally, I try to not go that far anymore, as well as the demand for it going down a little bit.  I’m trying not to do the huge volume but make more money on the product that we do have.  It keeps me off the road a little bit, from three-hour drives there, three hours back, and stuff like that.


Q:        [23:59] Yeah.  Have you made any changes here with –


A:        [24:02] As of right now, no.  There's really not too, too much more square footage in here to expand, but I'm hoping to in the future.  


Q:        [24:09] Yeah, can you talk a little bit more about those plans?  


A:        [24:11] Yeah.  Eventually, I'd like to buy the building that I'm in and have free range to do whatever I want to do.  I haven't really made up my mind of which direction I want to go in yet.


Q:        [24:23] Sure, cool.  That's really exciting.  Then, with reference to all of these changes you're doing to adapt to the increasing supply, do you think that those have been helpful or useful things for you?


A:        [24:33] Yeah, I think so.  It's just managing it every day.  Every day, there's something new that you have to adapt to and overcome, and it's just figuring it out.  It's a big puzzle and calling the right people and trying to figure stuff out.


Q:        [24:50] Yeah.  What's made it possible for you to be able to do that?  Do you feel like you're really drawing on relationships you have, trainings you've been to, or what’s made it possible for you to do that really fast adaptation?


A:        [25:02] A lot of it is just thinking on your feet, thinking quick of if there's a problem, how to rectify it pretty quick and different things like that.  If a truck breaks down, if it's a small fix, instead of waiting two weeks to get into a garage, just fix it yourself and get it back on the road type of deal, and definitely utilizing the people that you know and working with them and picking their brain quite a bit.  


Q:        [25:29] Yeah.  Do you feel like –?  When you're doing that, do you feel like you're drawing on your college experience or your internship in New Hampshire?  Are those things also informing the way that you're responding?


A:        [25:40] Definitely, yeah.  I think it's just a combination of all the experiences that I've had over the years all compiled together.  Working with Gabby at the internship, definitely going to college, working at other seafood places, and working on the boat and stuff.


Q:        [25:55] Yeah.  Can you actually take me through a little bit – work you did on the boat with your dad and some of the work with other seafood places?


A:        [26:04] Yeah.


F:        [26:06] (inaudible) you work or the time –?  Yeah.  


Q:        [26:07] Yeah.  The time frame I'm really interested in because, again, you are so young.


A:        [26:11] Yeah.  When I went out fishing with my dad, I was pretty young, and that was picking fish out of nets, measuring them on the back of the boat, and then cutting and gutting them, putting them on ice, bring them into port.  And then, as far as lobstering goes, it's just baiting traps, running traps, banding lobsters, different things like that.  I worked at a lobster company doing their retail market, just working retail there.  Did a little bit of processing, learned how to grade lobsters there.  Worked at another lobster company that was a little bit more on the wholesale side of things, as well as processing.  So, learning efficient ways to process lobsters a little bit more into the restaurant scene.  And then another lobster company that I worked at was more wholesale, so shipping and stuff like that.


Q:        [27:03] How old were you when you're doing all these things?


A:        [27:05] I mean, working on the boat, I think I've done that since I was probably 13, somewhere around there.  The fish market that I worked retail, I believe I was 16, 17.  One of the lobster companies, I was 18, 19.  And then the wholesale company that I worked at, I was, I'd say, again, 18, 19.


Q:        [27:29] Wow.  It's really amazing how many of these experiences really feel cumulative to this.  Can you talk a little bit about – I don't know – how that informs the work?  If you feel like it does, I guess.


A:        [27:43] Yeah, definitely.  It’s, like I said, just picking up knowledge everywhere that I've been and expanding on that and not necessarily trying to do things better, but do things a little bit more efficiently, and doing it that way.  


Q:        [27:59] Yeah.  As you look towards the future, what kind of things do you want to do to adapt, move forward, or grow?


A:        [28:08] Yeah.  I’d definitely like to expand the retail market.  I think it's been really nice to have people that come in and buy your seafood, and you know that it's going to be on their dinner table at night, connect the fishermen directly to the consumers a little bit more, and expand on the processing side of things.


Q:        [28:26] Yeah.  And what do you think –?  I'm curious, with the connecting the fishermen to the consumers – what do you think that looks like?


A:        [28:33] Yeah.  One thing that we do with the retail market is we tell people where their product came from, which boat it was harvested on, what day it was, what port it was brought in at, just so that way they start to get a little bit more familiar with that.


Q:        [28:49] Yeah, great.  Is there anything that you really want to do but you feel like you haven't been able to, or you're trying to work through as you look towards the future?  


A:        [28:58] Yeah, I guess just expanding in all aspects, really.


Q:        [29:02] Yeah, because it seems like really you're at the helm of all of it.


A:        [29:06] Definitely, yeah.  


Q:        [29:07] What is that like to be so –?  I don't know.  What is that like?


A:        [29:11] Yeah, it's managing a lot.  It's like managing a few different companies in one.  The bait is one.  Retail is one.  Wholesale’s, one.  Restaurant’s one.  It's a lot, but we make it work, and I'm thankful.  I've got a good crew, and they deal with me being scatterbrained and pivoting last minute all the time.  Like I said, we kind of run on a 10-minute basis.  We don't really know what we're going to be doing 10 minutes from now, so it's just figuring it all out.


Q:        [29:39] Yeah.  Did you have a question?


F:        [29:41] I have a few.  I just wanted to double-check.  What year were you born?


A:        [29:45] 1998. 


F:        [29:46] ’98.  Awesome.  I guess I was just thinking of the different species.  I see you have Jonas crabs and spider crabs.  You also mentioned maybe you also deal with green crabs sometimes.  I don't know if that's most of the time.  So, just which species?  I was curious.  You were talking about seeing blue crabs.  Do you guys retail in those yet?  Or is there not enough?  Is that something you're interested in in the future?  


A:        [30:07] Yeah.  The volume locally of blue crabs isn't enough to be able to market here.  I've been trying to get in touch with fishermen down south to be able to get them directly off of their boats and have them shipped up here.  Shipping is very expensive, so that is something that we're working on.  


F:        [30:24] And then, you do market green crabs.  Is that all the time, or is it sometimes, or you have in the past?  I was just curious.


A:        [30:31] Yeah.  That was something I did in the past.  Again, in college, I had a second business.  It was Green Bait, and it was using the green crabs as lobster bait.  And then I did the internship with Gabby to try and be able to get the crabs molt to restaurants and stuff like that.  


F:        [30:46] Were you guys able to do that successfully?  I know you can talk about the process, but were you able to get the soft-shell crab consistently?  


A:        [30:52] No.


F:        [30:55] One more question, which is, how many employees do you guys have?  


A:        [31:00] Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight – eight employees right now.


Q:        [31:08] Would you mind actually just running us through all of the species that you do carry?  


A:        [31:16] Yeah.  So, Jonah crabs.  We do the jumbo Jonah crabs, which are a pound and a half and up.  Inshore Jonah crabs.  We do have spider crabs available on occasion.  Live local lobsters.  We do steamers, mussels, oysters, crab meat, lobster meat.  We have a product that's smoked lobster meat.  We have some smoked mussels.  Sometimes, we'll offer like a bisque or a chowder.  As far as fish goes, pretty regularly, we do flounder, cod, haddock.  We've got some halibut out there, some swordfish, monktail.  And then, every once in a while, we'll throw in something different in there, trying to get more people in the door and introduce people to new species.  


Q:        [32:01] Cool.  When you look towards the future, what do you think your biggest concern is for the marine environment?


A:        [32:09] Right now, our biggest concern is what happened to the commercial gillnetting and dragging industry, which is government overreach, cracking down on regulations and stuff without very sound scientific data.  Then, on top of that is being able to get the infrastructure to keep up with the amount of product that we have, especially shedding lobsters and crabs and stuff.


Q:        [32:37] Yeah.  To the point of regulation, if you could talk to like a policymaker and say, “This is what I really think is important looking towards the future,” what would you say to that person?


A:        [32:48] I'd probably just take them out on the boat for the day and see what they do and see what we see and stuff like that.  Because unless you're on the boat doing it every day, you don't really see everything.  It’s hard to be able to sit in an office or a lab and come up with the decisions that are going to change people's lives. 


Q:        [33:04] Yeah, absolutely.  I'm curious, if you were to take someone out on the boat, what would the thing –?  What would you really emphasize to them while you're out there?


A:        [33:12] We have a very healthy lobster population.  We have tons of juvenile lobsters that are caught every day in the traps that are thrown back.  A lot of female lobsters with eggs underneath their tails, a lot of V-notch lobsters, a lot of oversized, a lot of undersized.  There's a lot of lobsters that are thrown back.  If your trap comes up and there's 10 lobsters in it, sometimes you're throwing all 10 back just because they don't meet the requirements, which is good.  It's a healthy stock,


Q:        [33:45] Yeah.  I'm curious.  With lobster and with the future and with regulation, how do you feel about the way that lobster is regulated, especially thinking about gillnetting and looking towards the future?  Sorry, if that's a complicated question.  I don't know that my point got across.


A:        [34:06] Yeah.  One thing that I've always said is that your fishermen, your lobstermen, they're the biggest environmentalists I know.  They don't want to see their livelihood get taken away.  They don't want to overfish.  I think the biggest thing for every fisherman is to be able to catch something and put it on their plate and have their family enjoy it.  Again, it’s hard seeing those people getting their livelihood taken away from them over people that have never done it.  They don't even know about it.  Oftentimes, we’ll get boarded by the Coast Guard or Fish and Game or something.   There's been so many stories from fishermen that the wardens weren't even using the right size gauges for lobsters, different things like that.  There's definitely a lack of communication, a lack of education, and a lack of trust, big time.  


Q:        [34:59] What do you think would build that trust?


A:        [35:03] Again, I think putting more people on boats every day so that you can just see what's going on and really appreciate what the fishermen are doing.


Q:        [35:12] Yeah, absolutely.  I'm going to transition to some questions about climate and other things.  Have you ever participated in any kind of climate resilience or general resilience adaptation training?  Anything like that?  


A:        [35:27] No.  


Q:        [35:28] What do you think might be an effective way to build resilience among fishermen and processors and other people who work with fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [35:38] Could you explain that a little bit more?


Q:        [35:41] Sure.  What do you think –?  You described with regulation and with a lot of the changes you're seeing in species, those are all things that people have to adapt to.  And I'm curious, what do you think would help people adapt?  Does that make sense?  


A:        [35:56] Yeah.  I think it would be, again, more understanding of what the fishing industry as a whole, whether it's fish or lobster, provides people.  What's the benefits of this?  It's all local-caught sustainably-harvest food.  It’s one of the basic necessities of life.  It's a protein.  Everybody needs it.  I think it's having lawmakers understand that and working with the fishermen.  


One thing that we're up against right now is the whole windmill ordeal, putting windmills out in the Gulf of Maine.  There, I don't feel like, has been enough research on the environmental impacts of that. The fishermen seem to think that they know what the impacts are going to be.  I would lean more towards believing the fishermen because they've been there their whole lives.  They know what the ocean in different areas looks like, what the prime breeding grounds are for codfish or for lobster and stuff like that.  I think that’s a wealth of knowledge that is starting to diminish as more and more people get out of it just because of that overreach.


Q:        [37:11] Yeah.  To the point of the windmills, are there any other non-environmental challenges that you're seeing that you really want to talk about?  


A:        [37:18] Yeah.  Infrastructure along the coast, all up and down the coast, is huge.  New Hampshire, there's really not that much infrastructure that I know about.  That's one thing that we're trying to work on.  Then, getting more processing facilities on the East Coast to be able to handle the product and stuff and spread it out a bit.  That way, it’s not just a few big companies, but if you had 100 smaller companies, there's more competition and stuff like that.


Q:        [37:51] Yeah.  Are you seeing movements to build that infrastructure, or how do you feel like that's going?


A:        [37:58] As of right now?  No.  No, I feel like a lot of it's getting pushed away.  In New Hampshire, we did secure about a million dollars to rebuild the building at the Portsmouth pier, but that's not for processing.  That's more cold storage for bait and stuff for the fishermen, which helps them in their expenses.  They can get cheaper bait and whatnot, but definitely need more help from the government on getting land, property, buildings, and equipment to process.


Q:        [38:28] You said rebuild.  Was that because of the storms we had earlier in the winter, or just –?


A:        [38:33] No, it's a very old building, so it's kind of weathered and hasn't been upkept, so it's time.


Q:        [38:39] I'm curious, have you seen any impact from the storms we had in the winter from your business?


A:        [38:48] Me personally, no.  But a lot of my boats, they had gear that was just mangled and stuff like that, traps that were pretty much folded in and different things like that.  


Q:        [39:01] Yeah.  Can you tell me about any opportunities or real positive change you've seen in your very long time working on water and doing this kind of stuff?


A:        [39:11] Yeah, I think some of the positives have been that there's a little bit more fact-checking, finding out what the truth is and what's not the truth and stuff like that, and sticking together with fishermen and some of the smaller people who try to do right by the boat to get them a fair price for their catch and whatnot, as well as the general public getting a little bit more knowledge on what's going on.


Q:        [39:42] Yeah.  As you look towards the future, what is your real hopeful vision for the future of Maine fisheries, aquaculture, marine industry in general?


A:        [39:50] I would really like to see more traceable seafood directly to the consumer.  I'd like the fishing industry as a whole to export a little bit less fish and stop importing as much fish, and just enjoy what we have locally.  Again, that goes into being able to process it.  Stop sending it overseas to get processed and then sending it back, as opposed to just process it here and enjoy it here.  That way, by the time you eat a piece of fish, it's not two or three weeks old.  It's caught a couple days before.  That'd be pretty cool.


Q:        [40:24] Yeah.  Have you noticed any difference in women's presence, status, participation in fisheries in your time?


A:        [40:32] Yeah, definitely.  I think there's a few women up and down the coast that have their own boat and run their own operations and stuff like that.  I think it's gaining traction a little bit, and it's nice to see.  I don't know too many females on the buying aspect of things, but there's definitely a few.


Q:        [40:51] Do you think you're just –?  Do you think that will continue to increase through time?


A:        [40:56] I don't know.  I think if the market allows for the industry to continue growing and there's viability in the future of the industry, I think we could see that.


Q:        [41:06] Great.  Is there anything else you wanted to mention before we conclude the interview?


A:        [41:14] No, I think that's it.  


Q:        [41:15] Great.  Hillary, do you have any questions?  


F:        [41:17] I think you kind of alluded to it, but I was just curious.  Is there anyone else doing what you're doing on your scale in Maine, New Hampshire, in the region?  My sense is no, or at least up where we are, I know there isn't.  Is there anyone else filling this niche in the processing?  As you mentioned, we know, historically, there was a lot of processing infrastructure.  It's mostly been a story of loss, but you came in, and you've established your business.  Is there anyone else like you out there?


A:        [41:43] Not off the top of my head.  Not that I can think of.


F:        [41:46] Yeah, wow.


A:        [41:47] Yeah.  


Q:        [41:48] Any other questions?


F:        [41:50] That's all.  Thank you so much.


Q:        [41:51] Great.  Well, thank you so much.  


A:        [41:52] Absolutely.


Q:        [41:53] I will turn this off.  


END OF FILE"
"22","Q:        [0:00] We usually just start with – how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:05] My name is Emily.  I guess that's how I usually introduce myself.  Emily Selinger from Maine.  I grow oysters. (laughter) 


Q:        [0:15] And what year were you born?


A:        [0:17] 1990.


Q:        [0:19] And can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:21] I grew up in South Freeport, in South Freeport Village, which is a historic little nook of Freeport that's on the Harraseeket River.  It's a very – like densely populated, just a couple of blocks of old houses, a couple blocks from the river.


Q:        [0:42] Where are your parents from?


A:        [0:45] My mom grew up most of her life in Maine.  She was born in Syracuse, but my grandparents relocated to Maine in the late '60s, I think.  She spent most of her life here in Camden, Maine, actually.  And my grandmother still lives there.  My dad grew up between New York City and Washington, DC, and then came to Maine for college, went to Bowdoin, and pretty much knew he wanted to stay after that.


Q:        [1:16] What do they do for work?


A:        [1:18] My dad is a lawyer.  He does mostly like housing law stuff.  And my mom is an artist.


Q:        [1:26] And do you have any siblings?


A:        [1:28] A younger sister named Hallie.


Q:        [1:32] What does she do?


A:        [1:33] She manages The Desert of Maine in Freeport.  She has a background working in like art museums and that world, and lived and worked in Boston for a long time doing that, and then moved back here to take over The Desert of Maine, because she wanted to be in Maine.


Q:        [1:50] Do you have any family history of working on the water, fishing, aquaculture, anything like that?


A:        [1:55] Not commercial.  Big family tradition of sailing and cruising, and that was my introduction to spending time on boats and on the water. 


Q:        [2:07] Can you tell me a little bit more about that?


A:        [2:09] Yeah, my grandparents when they moved here – they were both from Wisconsin.  They moved around.  My grandfather was a doctor in the army.  And they kind of bopped around when my mom and her siblings were young, then landed in Camden, and that was going to be the place that they stayed – right on the ocean.  My grandfather was just, I think, immediately captivated with the idea of learning how to sail.  That was his project.  He started messing around in small boats, and it led to them buying a larger cruising boat and then a transatlantic voyage to Ireland and that sort of thing.  So I grew up sailing on that boat with them, taking sailing classes down the street from the house that we lived in in Freeport.


Q:        [3:05] I'm assuming I know the answer to this, but just to follow the guide, do you have any history with your family of working in other roles, like adjacent to fishing, such as bookkeeping, processing, marketing, bait, gear, anything like that?


A:        [3:20] No, none.


Q:        [3:22] Are you married?


A:        [3:24] No.


Q:        [3:25] Do you have any children?


A:        [3:27] No.


Q:        [3:29] And could you describe your educational background a little bit for me?


A:        [3:31] Yeah.  I went to public schools in Freeport all the way through to high school graduation.  I did a freshman year of undergraduate study at Skidmore College and then left to take a couple years off to go sailing.  And then I went back, transferred to the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington, and I finished my undergrad degree there.


Q:        [3:56] What's your degree in?


A:        [3:58]  Art history.


Q:        [4:01] Very useful (inaudible).


A:        [4:02] Super.  Yeah, art history. (laughter) 


Q:        [4:05] You can tell.  Great.  We're going to sort of shift into your role in the sector.  How would you describe what you do in the fisheries or aquaculture sector of Maine?


A:        [4:16] I'm a business owner.  I have built a small four-and-a-half-acre oyster farm in Casco Bay pretty much from the ground up.  I've been in operation for about seven years now, and it's a full-time job for me and a part-time job for my sister and maybe some other folks down the road.


Q:        [4:38] Can you tell me a little bit about how you got into that?


A:        [4:41] Yes.  Sort of on accident through making a friend who was working on a PhD in marine science at the time and had started her own small oyster farm in Yarmouth, kind of just as a pet project, like for fun, with the dream of turning it into a business someday.  And we were connected.  She was working for my uncle, and he thought we would really hit it off.  And I had kind of come back to Maine and was sort of in a transitional phase and trying to figure out what I wanted to do like long term for work.  And she took me out – we met, and she took me out to her beginnings of an oyster farm in Casco Bay, and I just thought it was really cool.  I was kind of captivated and had a lot of transferable skills that seemed like that would make it a good fit.  And I kind of just jumped in and started my own small little operation and went from there.


Q:        [5:42] Can you talk about what really hooked you?  What made you want to do it?


A:        [5:48] I really liked that it was not taking anything out of the environment.  It was putting something in, but something that was arguably pretty beneficial for that place.  And I thought that was really cool.  I also just really liked oysters and was kind of like hooked on the novel idea that I could grow my own oysters from a very basic level.  And yeah, I also just liked the idea that it seemed like it was sort of a low entry point, in that I could get a license pretty easily to mess around and experiment and that the costs to get started with a small amount of gear weren't huge.  And I already had a boat and access to the water, which was pretty fortunate.  So it was kind of an easy door for me to walk through, and that was all really appealing.  And from there – yeah, it's just kind of snowballed from there.


Q:        [6:56] Can you talk a little bit more about what it was like to start doing it – to get everything set up?


A:        [7:02] Yeah, it was kind of a puzzle.  I felt kind of lucky that I had this friend in Amanda (sp?), who was also like not that far ahead of me.  So we could kind of commiserate and problem-solve together.  And there have been a lot of like – I don't know, just challenges to kind of figure out, but they've all been things that I have found a way through, which has made the progressively larger ones that I've encountered – you know, as the business has grown – they're all still like hard to navigate, but I'm a little bit better prepared for them, in the sense that they don't completely derail me anymore.  (laughter) Yeah, I have faith that I'll find my way through.  And that's been really cool.


Q:        [7:53] Can you talk a little bit about your farm now?  What does that look like? 


A:        [7:59] Yeah.  It's four and a half acres now.  I'm using most of that space.  I plant somewhere from 150,000 to 200,000 seed each year, and I harvest 75,000 to 80,000 of those in a year, which is a lot.  I work year-round, and I'm mostly on my own on the water.  So it's a lot of work for the time being.  But yeah, it's a full-time job.  I'm out there four or five days a week in the spring, summer, fall months, and a couple days a week in the winter, mostly just to harvest.


Q:        [8:44] Thanks.  So which licenses – which commercial licenses do you hold?


A:        [8:51] I hold so many.  I hold a aquaculture harvesting license that allows me to take oysters off my farm.  And I hold a standard lease for the farm.  And then I also have a dealer license, which allows me to sell my oysters to whoever I want, and most importantly, to go to farmers' markets, which was something that I really wanted to do from day one.  Yeah, I think that's it.


Q:        [9:26] Do you own your own boat?


A:        [9:29] I do, yeah.


Q:        [9:30] And can you talk a little bit more about your role on the boat?  I know you're really the only person out there a lot of the time.


A:        [9:37] Yeah.  I mean, it's like my taxicab out there.  It's a work platform also, because I don't have anything else right now out there to serve as a work platform.  It's a 19-foot outboard-powered skiff with a center console.  It's not really the ideal boat for this, but there are some things I like about it, and I have retrofitted some things to make it more useful.  It is what it is for the time being.


Q:        [10:11] Cool.  Do you have any experience in like bait and gear preparation?


A:        [10:17] Yes, in that I worked as a sternman for a few years.  So I handled bait pretty intimately in that role while I was starting the farm.  It was a great side gig.  There's no bait required in oyster farming now, thank God.


        And for gear work, I had never really used oyster gear in the past.  That was new and kind of a learning experience.  But I had done a lot of moorings and rigging and rope work and that sort of thing when sailing.  So I had a lot of transferable skills in setting up the structure of the farm, which was nice.


Q:        [11:06] Can you talk a little bit more about your experience sterning?


A:        [11:10] Yeah, it was two years – I think I fished for two years year-round with a lobsterman named Greg Griffin, who fishes out of Portland.  He was the father of a friend of mine.  And I had been working a full-time job, and yeah, it just – the oyster farm was more and more pulling me away from that, and I needed something – some way to keep making a decent amount of money and have a little more flexibility and time, and that seemed like the perfect transition.  It gave me kind of a cool – I had not had – you know, I grew up around lobstering, but hadn't had any direct interaction with it in that way.  And it was nice just in thinking about how I was going to site my farm in and around other folks and fisheries and just gave me some good baseline knowledge about how lobstering works and that sort of thing. So it was the perfect side gig.


Q:        [12:17] And how do you feel like – I don't know, like I'm curious about your impression of the relationship between farmers and lobstermen, having sort of had a hand in both.


A:        [12:29] I think it's evolved a lot in the last six years in my time in the aquaculture industry.  I think it got kind of like – I don't know what the right word is.  I think people think it's a lot more contentious than it is.  And the reality is that with the exception of a couple larger farming operations, most oyster farms, at least, are not sited in places where anyone is lobster fishing.  If they are, it's very infrequently, and it's a very small boat and that sort of thing.  So I don't personally experience a lot of conflict there, nor do I recall hearing very much about it in the time that I was more involved in the lobster industry.  I think that gets a little blown out of proportion.  Sorry.


Q:        [13:42] Sorry, this is going out of order, but just thinking about the marketing – you mentioned having the direct – marketing license or the dealer license.  And you mentioned farmers' markets.  Yeah, I just wonder if you can talk a little bit about the ways in which you sell.  It seems like you probably do a lot of your own direct marketing or maybe all – maybe talking a little bit about that.


A:        [14:03] Yeah, I do it all.  I kind of from the beginning knew that I wanted this to remain a pretty small business, because I didn't – I just like to be on the water.  I didn't want to get to the point where I was not going out on the water – I was sending other people out and managing and doing that kind of work.  Because I have done that in the past, and it doesn't really speak to how I like to be active.  So I knew I was going to keep it a smaller business.  And it felt like it might be wise, given how rapidly the industry was growing, to kind of set myself up to have a really diverse kind of collection of ways in which I could sell oysters throughout the year.


        And the farmers' market space – we have so many great farmers' markets in Maine and in this area in particular.  I wasn't seeing any oyster farmers at any of them, or any seafood for that matter, which it turns out there's some reasons for that, (laughter) which are challenging.  But I just really wanted to explore that, and it's been very worthwhile for a business of this scale.  Yeah, it's been awesome.


Q:        [15:30] So are there a few farmers' markets you go to?  And obviously they're seasonal – probably mostly – but maybe you can say a little more about that.  And also you maybe sell oysters here or – 


A:        [15:40] Yeah.  I go to the Portland Farmers' market year round.  They have a summer and a winter market.  That is my biggest market.  We also do, with the help of my sister, a second Saturday.  The Portland market is a Saturday market.  We also go to the Bath Farmers' Market on Saturdays in the summer, which is a mile down the road, which caters to all my neighbors, which is awesome.  When we're not at that market and also when we are there, my garage is kind of an honor system oyster pickup location, which is quite popular.  And last year, I also started attending a Friday farmers' market in Freeport, which I'm going to give another shot at this year.  It's a new market, and it's not very well known or attended yet.  But my other weekend markets have been awesome.  They are where the majority of my oysters are sold.


        And yeah, they are kind of in conjunction with a – I started a CSA for oysters – a CSF in fisheries, but I call it a CSA, because I really I personally think of aquaculture as being a lot more akin to agriculture, because we're not fishing.  So I started a CSA, which is like a loyalty program sort of deal where folks pay ahead of time for a lot of oysters that they can pick up throughout the season.  That's been very popular, and it really goes hand in hand with the farmers' markets with having like weekly places where people know that they can find me and the house pickup as well.


Q:        [17:33] Great.  That was actually right where I was going, but I'm curious if you have any other experience in marketing or trade or processing with the oysters that you think is worth mentioning.


A:        [17:42] No.  I mean, I'm really making it up as I go and experimenting with – I'm trying to find things that I'm not seeing other people do, mostly just to see what else works.  Yeah, I am really just making it up as I go.


Q:        [18:01] Do you do any cheffing events?


A:        [18:03] No, I do not have a catering license.  I decided that that does not make my heart sing, (laughter) so I don't do that.  I leave that to the pros.


Q:        [18:14] And do you have any experience in advocacy work or community-based organizations related to fishing or aquaculture?


A:        [18:22] Not really, no.  I have gotten a little involved since I've been in the industry.  But no.  No, I don't.


Q:        [18:31] When you say a little involved, like which particular organization or – 


A:        [18:35] Some like organic – like side organizations that have kind of cropped up in groups, and nothing that has really like taken off.  But I try to pay attention during legislative sessions and attend things that seem important.  That kind of involvement, I guess.


Q:        [18:58] Great.  And this is kind of a tough question to answer, but I'm curious if you could describe – like what does an average day look like for you?


A:        [19:06] There's a few different ones. (laughter) 


Q:        [19:09] Could you take me through all of them?


A:        [19:10] Yeah, it depends a lot on the season.  In the summer, the beginning of the week is usually dedicated just to farm work, so it's longer days on the water and a lot of maintenance and taking care of oysters.  And then the end of the week, as we get towards – market days are – Thursday or Friday or both are harvest days.  So it's typically a shorter day on the water, a longer day on land, just cleaning and prepping and, yeah, sorting oysters and getting ready for that.  And then weekends – Saturdays are pretty much always market day year-round, which is a shorter day, but strangely more exhausting (laughter) – a lot of talking to people.  And then winters are quieter.  There's a lot less time on the water.  But usually one short day out to harvest or two.


Q:        [20:11] In the winter, do you have some oysters in the lobster pound?  Or I know some people – I mean, most people sink their cages, but I know some people keep some floating in an ice-free place to be able to harvest in winter.


A:        [20:25] I don't have a lobster pound.  I wish I had a lobster pound.  That would be amazing.  I'm very envious of people who have lobster pounds.  No, Inner Casco Bay, in the last seven years, I've been growing oysters, has not frozen over completely.  It certainly has in the past, but it's been a while since it's done that.  And we get a lot of passing sea ice, but nothing that kind of stays.  So I have been able to harvest and get out there by boat I think pretty much consistently since I decided I was going to do that.


        I do sink everything, mostly because it helps me sleep better at night, and it's a lot less to worry about and maintain through the winter.  My fall involves a lot of grading and sorting oysters and putting aside everything that's ready to go to market and everything that's too small to go to market elsewhere so that I can sink them and know where all the market oysters are.  So it's a pretty quick and easy harvest run if the weather is not conducive to spending a lot of time out there.


Q:        [21:40] And what does the spring look like as you're sort of shifting into the summer, like workflow?


A:        [21:45] Spring is stressful and kind of chaotic, and it sort of goes differently every year.  It's a lot of like gear work here – building, mending gear, cleaning gear.  It's a lot of schlepping gear in the truck, in the boat, out to the farm.  Yeah, I generally am raising oysters in April whenever the low tides around the new moon happen, because that's the easiest time, and it coincides pretty closely with when the water starts to get moving upwards in temperature.  So that's usually the timeframe at which I raise all the oysters.


        And once everything is up, lots of gear makes its way out.  I tend to consolidate things before I sink it so that I can bring as much gear in as possible to get cleaned and fixed up.  So then all that gear goes back out, and the oysters get spread back out so that they have lots of room to grow.  I try to set myself up so that as things start growing, they have the room, so I'm not kind of frantically running around in June trying to spread things out.  So that's kind of where I'm at now.


Q:        [23:07] Cool.  And how do you feel like your background or identity shapes the work that you do?


A:        [23:13] Oh, gosh.  I'm sure it does.  I don't know.  I have a real just deep love of being on the water, and that shapes a lot of how I work, which is without a lot of mechanized equipment that makes a lot of noise.  Just because I can hear all the leaf blowers on land, and I don't really want to contribute to the cacophony out there in a place that is so beautiful and otherwise calm.  So it's pretty low-tech.  And I think that my sailing background kind of speaks to that.  I just like being out there and not having as – you know, having as little impact on the environment as I can.  What was the second part of that question?


Q:        [24:11] Just like how does your background or identity shape your work?


A:        [24:14] Oh, identity.


Q:        [24:16] How others perceive you.


A:        [24:20] I don't know how my identity – I feel like maybe my identity as a woman also plays a part in not wanting to be loud or obnoxious.  I use pretty small gear.  And that is also an attempt to have my neighbors feel comfortable with me being there and not like I'm a huge eyesore and – yeah, I think that both of those things play into that.


Q:        [24:50] Do you feel like that affects the way you're viewed in any way, those things?


A:        [24:55] Probably.  And I have talked to some other female friends who are farming, and in aquaculture in general, there's lots of conversations about social license and how you gain social license and acceptance from landowners and folks who work in other fisheries around you.  I have had a pretty easy time of that, and I think a lot of it is just tied to the fact that I am a woman and that I feel a little bit less threatening to people.


Q:        [25:26] I'm curious – you also worked for a little while as a sternman.  I guess I'm just interested if you noticed any sort of differences or similarities in the sense of how you might have been treated due to your identity, including being a woman.


A:        [25:40] I have a hard time telling, because I have always worked in male-dominated industries and in leadership positions in male-dominated industries and have been treated, I think, lots of different ways, good and bad, just because of my identity as a woman.  Lobstering was one place in which I felt very at home and treated just like anyone else from day one.  A little bit of that had to do with who I was fishing with, but also like the other boats and captains that we interacted with were people who were always nice to me.  And some of them I run into through other – you know, one of them tried to buy oysters for his seafood shack for a while.  Yeah, it was always a great work experience.


Q:        [26:40] And how do you feel like your work sort of relates to any family or caregiving responsibilities you might have, including any like future plans?


A:        [26:48] Yeah, that is an interesting question.  I don't have any kids.  I do have a partner.  We don't have any plans immediately to try and start a family.  And I honestly am not sure what I want to do in that regard yet.  So it hasn't affected my life at this point.  I am working very hard and a lot, and that is part of the reason I think I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about it.  And I do sometimes wonder if I wasn't working as much for this business as I am, if I would be in a different place.  But I don't have any strong feelings one way or the other, so I'm just going to keep going as I am.  And if that changes, I think we'll probably figure it out.  But it will be hard.  It would be hard to have caregiving responsibilities in my life greater than the dog right now.


Q:        [27:58] How does having the dog work?  How do you guys navigate that?


A:        [28:03] The dog – I should emphasize my partner and I don't live together right now.  The dog is my dog.  He spends most days with me.  He goes out on the water with me on days when there's room in the boat for him and days when we're not harvesting and days that aren't too hot or raining. (laughter) I'm lucky.  My parents live in Freeport.  They love him.  He spends a day or two at their house during the week.  I have a great neighbor next door who is often home who is another option to let him out in the middle of the day if I'm going to be gone.  So we make it work.  He goes to farmers' markets with me.  He is everyone's favorite.  But yeah, that has been – I really wanted a dog, wasn't sure how it was going to fit into things.  My parents initially were like, absolutely not.  But they fell in love with him.  So it's worked out.  It's been fine.


Q:        [29:12] Cool.  And sort of like shifting towards environmental changes, can you describe any changes in the marine environment you've noticed in your time on the water?  Like you could start even as far back as like sailing, lobstering.  Yeah.


A:        [29:23] Yeah, I'm farming on water that I grew up sailing and swimming in and have spent most of my life around, and it's definitely warmer than it was in the summer.  It warms up earlier and it stays warmer later.  That's very apparent to me.  I think our weather patterns also feel very different than I remember them being as a kid, both in the summer, but year-round.  And that's just like – you know, we have stormier shoulder seasons, a lot more wind than I ever remember as a kid, and yeah, kind of unpredictable, weird temperature patterns.  Lot of rain last summer.  Sounds like that might be something that might be more of our normal existence.  But previous years, we were in a drought and it didn't rain at all, which was kind of traumatic to go from that to rain every other day.


        Yeah, I think there have been some ecosystem changes that I've noticed just because I have spent a lot of time in small boats in shallow water – just less eelgrass.  The salt marsh, which is near where my parents live – there's definitely some erosion that's happening there, some weird different species.  The green crabs have had a very noticeable impact.  They are everywhere.  And I think those are the big things.


Q:        [31:05] How is that impacting your work?


A:        [31:08] The longer warmer-water season means oysters are growing and awake for longer, which means more work just taking care of them, potentially.  I'm lucky that my site is as shallow as it is, because it means that there's not a huge shift in temperature and environment when I do choose to put the oysters down on the bottom for the winter, which I like to do a little bit earlier than some others, just because we seem to get more and more damaging windstorms in October and November and early December.


        But that temperature – delay in the water cooling off is potentially something that will impact my kind of plans around that more in the future.  They don't seem to be yet, but we had a very warm winter this year, which is weird.  And I'm not sure I noticed any specific changes around that, but I know it plays a role in the thriving green crab population, which are abundant this spring.


Q:        [32:30] Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing with those and how that's impacting your work?


A:        [32:34] Yeah, there's just tons of them.  I feel like I'm seeing more bigger ones, which is new.  Because I keep most of my oysters in gear, they are pretty well protected from the crabs.  I have friends who do more bottom planting in the area, and they have noticed that oysters that they used to plant are now getting eaten by green crabs.  So they're having to grow things out in gear for longer and waiting until the oysters are bigger before they plant them to make sure that they are safe from hungry crabs.  That seems like that's been a pretty noticeable impact there.


Q:        [33:40] You mentioned them sort of along with salt marsh erosion.  Are those related, do you think, or they're just (multiple conversations; inaudible) them?


A:        [33:46] I don't know.  Yeah, it's just something else I've noticed.  That could just be something that happens, too.


Q:        [33:53] Have you seen any other differences in species other than the green crabs?  Anything you've seen more of or less of?


A:        [33:59] I don't think so.  I think the other – I don't have a lot else going on on the bottom on my site.  There's a good healthy amount of European oysters, which have always been there.  I have started having some problems with boring sponge, which I think has always been around, but maybe there's more of it.  I don't know.  It doesn't seem like there's a lot of information out there on the timing for when that species reproduces and sends its spores out to settle on shellfish.  I can't find much online about that.  So it could just be a fluke, and one year I had a lot of it and then the next year, not so much.


Q:        [34:57] I was going to ask about biofouling.  Have you noticed changes in biofouling?


A:        [35:01] Biofouling has definitely gotten worse.  Yeah, there's more species of tunicate seemingly every year – different ones and stronger ones and – yeah, definitely.  Our water still seems to get cold enough that most of them die off in the winter or stop growing, which is good.  I really hope that doesn't change.  Because that's a – yeah, they're crazy.  They were crazy this past winter.  The tunicates were wild, yeah.


Q:        [35:40] Yeah, and all this stuff like the tunicates, the changing water, the green crabs – are you trying anything to cope with that or adapt to it?


A:        [35:49] Yeah, I'm always kind of experimenting with the best way to deal with biofouling.  I'm a little limited, just because I don't have a lot of equipment involved in my operation.  So it's a lot of air-drying mostly to manage the explosion of things – tunicates, mussel seed when that shows up.  Yeah, that's been kind of the most successful thing is to figure out how to really effectively air-dry periodically throughout the warmest months.


Q:        [36:27] And what are some of the – you said you've been doing other experiments.  Are there any other things you found that really didn't work?


A:        [36:33] Yeah, I've messed around with how high or low in the water my gear floats.  It seems like everything with oyster farming is like you try something new, and there's some other tradeoff.  It's like pick your easiest to deal with evil. (laughter) Nothing has been like a perfect solution.  I think the things that have worked the best have just been getting the gear and the oysters out of the water periodically.  Yeah, nothing has been a complete failure, but it's a lot of small adjustments to things to try and make it that much better.


Q:        [37:26] Can I ask if you've had any – if you see a link between environmental change and bacteria diseases like Vibrio, and if that affects your work?


A:        [37:37] That is hard to say.  Vibrio seems like there is evidence to suggest that it's getting worse in more parts of Maine, and those regulation changes seem great for that reason.  I think I've been pretty conservative from the get-go with how I operate with harvests in the summer, so it doesn't change how I operate.  It's still just lots of ice.  And it's a little bit easier – because I am my own dealer, I can manage the receiving so it is easy on the paperwork with the ice and just making sure everything's at temp when it comes to me – by me. (laughter) Yeah, so that doesn't – that I don't think will affect me that much, that shift.


        Our biotoxin closures seem – I don't know enough about what makes for a bad red tide year.  They seem very random to me.  I don't know.  We've had a very easy couple of years in that sense, at least in southern Maine, which has been nice.  I don't know.  I think the first year that I was selling, there was a very extended PSP closure that was kind of a bummer.  But since then – I can't remember if it was 2020 or 2019 – since then, we really haven't had much of any, I don't think, which is nice.


Q:        [39:31] What about any relationship – I mean, you talked about temperature changes, definitely.  Are you noticing any – like that your oysters are spawning or any change around that or any concern around that?


A        [39:45] No.  They definitely – I mean, I tend to buy diploid seeds, so I expect them to spawn at some point.  I was actually on the water when they spawned last year, which was really cool, for the first time.  That seems like it happens pretty early – maybe earlier than usual – than I would have expected last year.  Makes me wonder if we might have longer and longer growing seasons – if we might start to have more than one spawning in a summer, which could be kind of annoying.  They tend to be a little – I feel like my oysters are a little fragile around that time.  They don't like to be out of water for very long.  They don't last as long.  Yeah, it's a little – this one ache in my business model is just that summers are such a popular time for people at farmers' markets to buy oysters.  And if there was one time of year, just from the standpoint of wanting to sell a quality product, that I would not want to be selling oysters, it's in the middle of the summer. (laughter) But, you know, I have proven to myself that I can do it well and safely at this point.  So I will continue.  But it does – it makes me anxious around spawning when I know that they're not as strong as usual.


Q:        [41:18] And just to go back to the drying, how often do you find you need to do that in order for it to be really effective?


A:        [41:24] I am not capable of doing it often enough for it to be as effective as I would like.  I am a bit of a perfectionist, though, so some of that is me just being like there's still a lot of slime on that and wishing it wasn't there.  But I'm able to do it enough that things are things are clean enough.  You know, I'm not having issues with oysters not thriving because the gear is so fouled that they can't.  But it's definitely beneficial for me to be proactive about it, just because it makes everything so heavy.  And then if we get a storm while things are really heavy, that does a lot more damage on the gear.  Yeah, it's something I spend most of the summer doing, I think, is dealing with fouling.  I think that's like 90% of oyster farming.


Q:        [42:23] Sort of shifting the topic a little bit, did you see any effect from the two storms we got a little earlier this year?


A:        [42:29] My oysters were all on the bottom, and because I'm far enough in Casco Bay, we don't get the sea swell.  We just get a vicious wind chop.  And as long as my oysters are on the bottom, they tend to fare pretty A-OK through that.  So I came out unscathed.  The boat was fine.  Actually, I had hauled the boat for some maintenance and then elected to just keep it out of the water for storm number one and then storm number two when that was apparent that it was coming.  So I did OK through that.


Q:        [43:08] What about like the infrastructure you use, like the dock?


A:        [43:12] The town landing in South Freeport was underwater, and the floats were at the tops of the pilings, but everything survived.  Again, we're lucky that we're protected from the swell.  But yeah, things came out okay.


Q:        [43:36] With all these different things that you were seeing and trying, I'm curious – what's made it possible for you to sort of adapt in the ways you've adapted?  And I have more to that question if you need more like to feed the answer.


A:        [43:50] I don't know.  I think the fact that this business is so small and that I'm not trying to provide a living for anyone else is really nice, and it allows me to spend – to just invest more money on time to try new things out and prototype things and invest in things that seem like they're going to be really helpful in the long run.  Yeah, I think that's the biggest.


Q:        [44:33] And did you draw on any like resources, relationships, training, organization, anything like that when you were thinking about these?


A:        [44:40] A lot on friends – a lot of friends in the industry now.  Yeah, there's a lot of information sharing that has been very helpful.  And I rely on Sea Grant occasionally for help finding answers for things.


Q:        [45:05] Can you talk a little bit more about the information-sharing aspect of that?


A:        [45:09] It's a lot of just, you know, problem-solving with friends.  Hey, have you seen this?  What do you do about it?  What do you think about this?  I have two really good friends in the industry now who both run their own small farms and have started from the ground up.  So they've also tried lots of different things.  They have different farm environments than I do, and they use different gear.  So it's kind of – I'm definitely guilty of kind of getting stuck in my ways of doing things and building things.  And often when things feel hard, it's hard to like imagine what could possibly make it easier.  So having friends who are growing oysters in different ways has proven to be very helpful when navigating those – wanting to make some things easier.  I've gotten some great ideas from people.


Q:        [46:11] And do you find that sort of across the board, people are seeing similar things or having similar problems?


A:        [46:17] I think so.  I only really know on a close level people who are operating on a very small scale, too.  So I don't know what larger farms are up against or what folks who are trying to employ any number of people are encountering.  I have the sense that their challenges are very different from mine.  I'm not sure, though.  But yeah, because I have elected to sell oysters in a very different way than most people, I'm a little bit outside of the larger main oyster market bubble that people are in.  And there seems like there's more and more competition there and more variation in pricing and that sort of thing.  I'm a little insulated from that, just because I only wholesale really in the winter when everybody is clamoring for oysters. (laughter) There aren't as many on the market.  So yeah, I'm not totally sure.


Q:        [47:32] I'm curious – are there any adaptations you've thought about making that you haven't done yet or that you'd really like to make?


A:        [47:38] Yes.  I'm kind of just jumping into – I'm buying a barge this weekend, (laughter) a pontoon barge, which will hopefully serve as an alternate work platform that I'm hoping to figure out how to get a mooring out on or near my lease, where that can live in the summer as just another work surface, maybe someday as a solar-powered oyster grader and just something to use as a drying platform as well.  That's my biggest next puzzle.


Q:        [48:23] And when you look – like even far past that, is there anything you really want to do?  Or what does that look like?


A:        [48:30] I am not sure yet.  I'm pretty happy just doing what I'm doing and just trying to get as many oysters out and just live my life the way that I want to.  I think that was my biggest goal.  And it would be nice if I could figure out – I could continue to like improve my operations so that things are a little bit easier here and there.  I'm sure there are ways to make things easier.  And yeah, I think it would be nice someday when I have better infrastructure to have some help on the farm, too.  Something like a work platform will make that a lot more possible.  Someday maybe a bigger boat would also help.


Q:        [49:26] And as you look towards the future, what is your biggest concern for the marine environment?


A:        [49:34] I'm always worried about bad actors, I think, in aquaculture and outside of it.  And I'm worried about our water quality.  And I'm worried about the greater other unknown, sort of known impacts that like just changing climate might have on the marine environment.  A lot of it just feels kind of existential.  Like it's hard to imagine what 65-year-old Emily is doing, because it just seems too uncertain that like it will even be tenable to grow oysters that far out.  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't think about that a lot, to be honest.


        Something I do think about, though, is just Freeport has – in all of the years that I've spent there has changed so much demographically, and the working waterfront continues to get smaller, and the pleasure boating waterfront continues to expand dramatically.  Not that people shouldn't be out enjoying the bay, but there's a lot of people out there who don't know the first thing about common courtesy on the water.  And it's scary sometimes.  Yeah, it's intrusive.  It's like just people going so fast everywhere all the time, not paying attention, running into oyster farms and like just – yeah.


        So that, I think, is a very acute Casco Bay/South Freeport problem.  I don't think that that happens as much everywhere, but we have a big harbor and a lot of room for people to keep boats, and there's so many more people on the water than there ever were when I was a kid.  And there's plenty of room, but it would be a lot more comfortable if there was a little bit more order and a little bit less – just it feels like there's an attitude of like there's no rules out there lately. (laughter) COVID had, I think, a very powerful impact on that.


Q:        [52:07] Yeah.  And sort of like with those problems in mind, if you could tell like a policymaker what their biggest priority should be with reference to that, what would you say?


A:        [52:19] I would love to see a shift away from aquaculture being the bottom of the pecking order out there.  Like we essentially have to prove that we are not going to get in anyone's way ever when we apply for a lease.  Yeah, it would just be nice if there was a little bit more respect for the industry and kind of like a conscious decision that this is something that we want to have in our waterways and that we want to support it, and that means that people are going to have to go around it sometimes.  I think a lot of how that process is set up makes a lot of sense, but it is – I think just in the interest of making things easy, like nothing has to happen there.  Nothing else can happen there.  Which is hard – hard to find that space.


Q:        [53:26] And you mentioned that – like running through an oyster farm.  Has that happened?


A:        [53:32] Yeah.  Yes, it's happened to me.  It's happened to other folks in the area.


Q:        [53:37] Like pleasure boats?


A:        [53:38] Yeah.  There's a lot of anger from people who own pleasure boats about oyster farms and things in the water.  They're not supposed to be there.  It's like, well, actually, yes, they are all documented.  There is this handy map.  You can go add them to your chart plotter if you want.  It would be nice if there was a way for us to – you know, without having to pay for it, for our operations to be included in NOAA's charts so that they just automatically showed up on chart plotters and that sort of thing.  Because people really in our tech age are really glued to their screens when they're blasting about into the sun at sunset instead of paying attention to what's going on around them.


Q:        [54:26] Just thinking about the opposition and conflict over space, how did it go – like your leasing process, like the hearings?  Did you have opposition at that time?


A:        [54:35] I did not.  And I am right next to shore.  I have a bunch of riparian landowners.  I had one family that was concerned, but they had images of larger farms and bigger gear and that sort of thing.  And then it was pretty easy to quell their fears, to be like, no, no, no, like that little thing.  It helped that I had been growing on LPAs in the same area for a while, and I had a small version of what my farm was essentially just going to look like.  So it was pretty easy to be like, you can't even see this, hardly, from your lawn.  It's just going to be more of that.  So it went well for me, but there have been some like snarky comments from other people that I don't know well since – like, oh, your farm's in my way.  Sorry. (laughter)  I think that's always going to be a thing.


Q:        [55:39] And sort of like switching back into climate, have you participated in any climate resilience – like adaptation training, any kind of program like that?


A:        [55:49] No. 


Q:        [55:52] And what strategies do you think would be really effective in building resilience against those kind of things?


A:        [55:56] I don't know.  That's really not my area of expertise.  I'm not sure.


Q:        [56:04] Are there any other kind of changes, like not just environmental ones, that are really impacting your work you want to talk about?


A:        [56:11] I think that I've already covered it.  The changing demographics really is the thing that I think I feel the most.


Q:        [56:23] Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive change you've seen in your time on the water?


A:        [56:28] I think in the last seven years – my timing in getting into this was just so – that I think I've seen a pretty remarkable general knowledge of aquaculture that has kind of come down on especially other fisheries and industries of that nature, which is nice.  It kind of feels like it's not the outlier quite so much anymore.  It is more part of the fabric.  I think that folks like me who keep a boat on a commercial wharf with a bunch of other lobstermen and clammers – like that has a big impact on that, like just getting to know people and chit-chat in the parking lot.  Again, because I'm a woman, I think I'm more approachable than most.  So those kinds of relationships have been pretty easy.  And that's been nice.  I feel like that has – you know, it may not have reached the masses yet, the folks who are less tied in with commercial industry.  But it seems like within that bubble, it's kind of become a part of it and is less of an other now, which is nice.


Q:        [57:57] And have you noticed any changes in women's presence, participation, status, anything like that over time?


A:        [58:03] Definitely more women on the water in specifically aquaculture roles, either working for people or starting farms, which is cool.  I think that's kind of just because of where our society is, finally, and the fact that it is still like an emerging industry and there's room for more people to get in more easily.  Also, the capital barrier to start a really small farm is pretty low.  So that's been cool.


        Because I'm kind of a pessimist about things like this, I worry that like in 15 years that that's not going to continue to be the case because of all of the same old reasons that women drop out of things – you know, childcare, household duties, that sort of thing, because our society hasn't necessarily progressed as much on that front.  And that is really what keeps women back, not whether or not they can just get a job, you know?  So yeah, it is nice to have more women around, though.


Q:        [59:19] And sort of as you look towards the future, what is like a hopeful vision for the future of Maine's fisheries and aquaculture?


A:        [59:25] I think one where we don't get squeezed out by landowners and dwindling waterfront access and dwindling affordable waterfront access.  Yeah, that one.  Yeah, working waterfronts that are protected and respected for what they are, not just on a state level.  You know, you hear a lot of good stuff about it from state-level stuff, and then municipal decisions are often a very different thing, because those people are hearing directly from people who don't want to look at somebody's pile of gear somewhere and who would rather that that public boat ramp that all the clammers used be turned into a park – you know, something like that.  There's a lot of that that happens, and it would be nice if it was a little bit more protected and there was a little less anxiety about whether those resources were going to go away.


Q:        [1:00:35] Is there anything else you want to share with us before we sort of conclude the interview?


A:        [1:00:40] I don't think so.  I don't know.


Q:        [1:00:44] Hillary, do you have any more questions?


Q:        [1:00:45] I guess I'm just struck by – you're right here in Bath.  The water's right there.  I'm just curious why you fish out of – or why you launch out of Freeport.


A:        [1:00:54] I couldn't afford to buy a house in Freeport.  That's why I'm here.  But Freeport is where I grew up.  That's where I have water access.  My parents live there, and they love me, and they like oysters.  So they let me use their property to store gear and to keep the boat.  And I knew the folks at the commercial wharf, so it was easy to get a slip there that I could afford and not need to get on a marina waiting list.  So it just made sense to add the commute from here to Freeport in.


Q:        [1:01:32] So you kind of have the familiarity, relationships – 


A:        [1:01:35] Yeah.  I was afraid – and I was very fortunate in my timing, because if I had waited another two years, I wouldn't have been able to buy anything anywhere within an hour of Freeport.  But I really felt like I was pretty sure that I wanted to stay in Maine.  It would have been impossible to build this business this way without owning property to build.  You know, the garage is my licensed dealership.  I have a little oyster room in there that gets inspected twice a year.  Yeah, it would have been really hard to structure a business this way without property.


Q:        [1:02:17] Definitely.  Yeah, thank you.


Q:        [1:02:18] Yeah, great.  I'll go ahead and turn this off.


END OF FILE"
"23","Q:        [0:00] OK, just to start how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:03] My name is Krista Tripp.  I'm a lobster woman.  I'm an oyster farmer.  I also go elver fishing, and I'm a mom.


Q:        [0:16] Great and what year were you born?


A:        [0:18] I was born 1985 my birthday is June 1st.  


Q:        [0:24] Great.  Thank you.  And can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:27] I grew up down here on the island.  My parents live right next door which is wonderful because my son can go over and visit his grandparents whenever.  And yeah, this has been in my home my whole life.


Q:        [0:45] Great and where your parents from and what did they do when you were growing up?


A:        [0:48] My mom is from Warren, which is very close to here and my dad is – he grew up down here.  So he was raised here as well.  


Q:        [1:02] And do you have any siblings?


A:        [1:04] I have an older sister, a younger sister and a younger brother.  So I'm child number two, which is the worst.  Yeah, the first born, the middle child and then John is the only boy and then my younger sister is the baby.  So that's why it’s the worst for me


Q:        [1:24] Do any of them fish or work on the water in any way? 


A:        [1:26] Yeah, yeah, my brother.  He's a phenomenal fisherman.  He fishes offshore, like my dad.  My younger sister went stern man for a while and my older sister's dabbled in the fishery, but she she's mostly been a nurse and a mom, so – yeah, 


Q:        [1:48] And you mentioned your dad, can you talk a little bit more about him and what he does on the water?


A:        [1:52] He – so he's an offshore fisherman.  He's a legend.  He's been fishing for a very long time and he's very good at what he does, and yeah, he's been doing it since he was just a wee little boy.  He knew within his life that this is exactly what he wanted to do and he made sure that that he was able to do, like fresh out of high school.  Whereas his sister went to college his brother went to college.  It was something that he just knew he was going do so he didn't even try the college thing.  He's like, I'm going be a fisherman and he's yeah, he's made it his life  


Q:        [2:43] Wow, and are any of those people or any other members of your family – do you have any other history of fishing?  


A:        [2:50] Yeah, so my aunt after she got out of college, she did – I think she opened up a business for herself.  She owned the Dairy Queen in Rockland and then after that
she hopped on the lobster boat with my grandfather and was stern man for him for years.  It's just one of those things once you do it when you're younger you just kind of always – it gets in your blood and you want to go back and you want to do it.  My uncle, he graduated college and he was really big into to sports.  I think he was a coach, a baseball coach for a lot of the teams around here for many years, but he also went back lobstering and he doesn't fish offshore, but he's still a very good fisherman.  


Q:        [3:37] And do you have any family history of people working in roles outside of directly fishing, for instance, bookkeeping, processing, marketing that kind of thing


A:        [3:47] No, no, no none – of none of that.


Q:        [3:53] Great and are you married? 


A:        [3:55] I am married.  Yes.  I am.  We've been we got married in 2017 – I think so it's been God, wow a long time for us.  You don't even realize how long it's been until you say it out loud, I guess.


Q:        [4:13] Great and do you have any children?


A:        [4:16] We have one son he's two and a half his name is Sebastian and he's literally the apple of my eye.


Q:        [4:24] And would you want – when you picture the future would you want him to go into fishing or another marine related industry?


A:        [4:30] I would yeah, I really think that it's a good way of life, fishing.  I love it and I know that he loves it too already.  So he asks me every day can we go for a boat ride today mom?  So I think that he'll want to want to do it.  I just worry about, what's going happen to the lobstering industry and such.  So that's the reason I diversified into oyster farming. 


Q:        [4:58] Great, yeah, I want to talk – I want to come back to that really soon.  Yeah, but I'm just curious you does he get out on the water with you often?


A:        [5:03] He does, not as often as he would like.  But he does.  He comes out and helps out, he'll pick up oysters and break them and I haven’t brought him out on the lobster boat yet just because he's been too young for that.  And there's so many things that could happen.  I have an old engine so I just didn't don't really like that, but on the oyster farm he's very safe.  He's a lot safer I feel, and we're getting a new boat.  So he's going be even more safer.  So I won’t have to worry


Q:        [5:40] Awesome.  Thank you and can you describe your educational background?


A:        [5:43] Yes, so I went to school here, I graduated high school in Rockland.  I went to college after that for a little bit.  I loved it.  I loved school.  I was always really good at school.  I was really book smart, I was definitely a teacher's pet.  I was – I think I got most mischievous, but I was also teachers pet.  I was very I was good in school and college I loved it.  But I got to a point where I just wasn't sure if I was going to use my degree and there was a lot of people around me at the time that were – I was hearing stories of people graduating and owing so much debt and  they weren't sure if they were if they were going to do what they wanted in school and they just  – so I just wasn't sure if it was worth it to me at the time so I got done and I went  into fishing and jumped on a boat.  


Q:        [6:55] And how would you describe your role in fishing and/or aquaculture?  How would you describe that to me? 


A:        [7:02] My role, I mean, I guess I'm somewhat of an entrepreneur, especially in this area because no one knows about aquaculture here.  And one winter I was interested in it and I took a class at the Island Institute in Rockland and I really liked it and so I started volunteering on an oyster farm every Sunday on my days off from haul.  Haul is lobstering, by the way, so I liked it and then the guy was retiring and gave me first refusal on the farm and I was, I don't know, I don't know, if I'm ready to take over a farm as the as a owner and manager but I did a lot of praying around it and at the time lobstering was up against a lot of scrutiny with the windmills and, and whales and still is.  And I thought well, why not try it?  It's worth the risk.  If you don't try, you're never going to get anywhere regardless.  So if I fail, at least I tried, 


So I bought the farm and I spent every single day out there as long as I could for the first few years after haul, I'd come in, I'd go out to the oyster farm.  I'd be working out there until 8:00 at night.  Getting up at 4:00 in the morning and going to haul and working very long days and, and eventually through just a lot of  talking with other people at different farms and seeing the layout of my farm and learning the tides that are in the river, I decided to set my farm up a little bit differently.  And after I did that – it's just boom, taking off and we're very successful now.  I've put in a lot of free labor but in any business you have to do that, right? 


So, it's been a labor of love, but I'm glad I did it because we're seeing really good results and a turnover from it since when I first started it.  It was a hobby farm and we've scaled it tremendously from where we started, so I'm proud about it.


Q:        [9:43] And how many years has that been since you started? 


A:        [9:47] Six.  This is my sixth year.   


Q:        [9:51] And how long were you lobstering before that? 


A:        [9:53] I was actually on a waiting list for lobstering license for 14 years, so I did a lot of work on the back of boats while I was waiting to get my captains license and I finally got my captains license.  And then two years after that I started oystering.  So I – who opens up two businesses at once, two startup businesses.  I'm crazy, I know, I don't know how smart it was, but I've made it work and I just live off the bare minimum and put everything back into my businesses and that's why they've been successful, I think.  


Q:        [10:32] And you also elver?  You fish elvers too? 


A:        [10:34] Yes, and elver as well.  Yes.  Yes, and what an experience that as been.  The first year I elvered, I couldn't believe – I had won the lottery.  I was so happy and thrilled and excited. I was jumping up and down because my father had told me previously, he was like – he's don't enter that.  You're never going to win.  And I was – I'm going to enter just because he told me not to.  And I won and it was amazing because at the time, I was really struggling.  I had my boat, my new boat I was paying for ropes, trap, buoys.  I really needed the money in the spring to put back into my boat to get it running in good condition.  And put back into my gear and my materials so that I could continue building my business.  Without that I wouldn't be where I am today for sure.  Yeah.  


So – but at the beginning, I didn't know anything.  I was what is this elver stuff,  this industry I know nothing about.  It's not something I grew up doing.  I never even heard anyone really talk about it very much, elvering, which surprises me, because then I found out that I know people that elver around here and they're just very secretive about it, I guess.  I was why did this never come up in conversation?  


So I had a lot of learning to do in the beginning.  I got a little spot all to myself and it was good for the first year.  I was able to catch my quota that first year, right in that  spot, but the second year that spot dried up.  And I was, OK, now I got to start looking in different areas to try to catch my elvers.  I had to start traveling north and meeting new people and going into the different territories, which was kind of scary, because you hear about really dangerous things that have happened to people and I just didn't know what to expect.  


So I tried to go with someone as much as I could the first few years, but – and I was dipping and then I got pregnant.  And I was crawling around jagged rocks and, climbing up and down huge, steep, very steep hills to river banks.  And I was, this is so dangerous.  I can't do this next year.  And so I applied for a fyke net (sp?) the following year because I was just, I was really lucky I didn't fall and get hurt.  And that year, I didn't have help with my husband.  He was fishing and he couldn't help me.  


So I was I was alone and, that was scary, but I was like, I have to make this money.  I have to go do this.  I have to catch my eels.  So I got through that year and it was a rough, rough year finding eels that year.  I think that's, I think that was the year of COVID, too, even, I can't remember to be exact because they all my years just kind of run together at this point.  But yeah, after that, I got a fyke net. (sp?) And then I was, OK, so now I got a fyke net, (sp?) still no idea what I'm doing.  Trying to – how do I set this up?  And I have a newborn baby that needs to be breastfed.  And so luckily that first year, I think my husband was home to kind of stay with the baby as I tended my net or he would come with me and we have the baby sleeping in the truck while I tended the net.  This year –last year, he was gone and I was alone with the baby and it was terrible.  


So I found a young girl to help me tend my net, which was so wonderful because I don't know what I would have done without her.  But my son would be screaming and crying he was, he wasn't used to her and her holding him and so we were trying to juggle that.  And so a lot of the times, I was just  – I was just stressed.  I was, how am I going to do this?  But I got through it.  I got through the year and she was wonderful.  If it wasn't for her, I'd be so screwed, excuse my French, but I would have been, because I didn't know how to check a net by myself.  So this year I did everything by myself.  My husband was home, so I was lucky enough that he helped me set up my net but he had to go fishing.  So I was left alone again, but my son is old enough.  


So he's – and I have a child lock in the back.  So I can put up the middle part and he hasn't figured out how to put the middle part down, to get into the front seat.  So I'm, OK, this is working.  I just put the window down a little bit and he, so he could watch me check my net in the river, which he loves.  He's yelling out the window the whole time but he – yeah, he's, he was really good this year and it just, it worked really well this year with him being older and stuff.  And now I'm a little bit more seasoned, so I can do things on my own, and it's not too big of a deal.  So – yeah.  


Q:        [16:50] Yeah, and how do you foresee looking towards the future?  Do you think he'll end up helping you or where do you think that'll look? 


A:        [16:55] I think that he'll definitely be helping me.  He loves to help.  He's – I just saw someone today.  It was does he help you?  And he's, yeah, I'm a good little helper.  He goes so he – he just, yeah, he's definitely going to be a good help.  


Q:        [17:16] Great.  And sort of moving back to when you started fishing in all these
different capacities, what really hooked you?  What made you want to go fishing? 


Q:        [17:23] So I grew up on an island and we live out there every summer and I was a
teenager at the time.  So I was really, I would get bored.  We were out there
and the beach was fun, collecting seashells was fun, swimming was fun, all that stuff was fun.  Finding mice, chasing mice with my dog.  All that stuff was fun, but  I would get bored.  And so then my dad got us a boat and we all shared the
boat and I just could not wait to get up in the morning and go fishing because I just felt when I was fishing I was doing something exciting.  I was productive, there was reward at the end of the day when you go to sell your lobsters.  It was just, it was really fun and exciting for me.  I got to run a boat.  And so I just, I fell in love with that at our early age really, really early.  It gave me something to do and – yeah.  


Q:        [18:46] And so what are all of the licenses that you hold now? 


A:        [18:48] I hold a lobstering license, a oystering license, or aquaculture license and an elver license.  


Q:        [18:58] And with a lobster, do you fish inshore or offshore?  


A:        [19:01] I fish inshore.  Yeah, I'm pretty close to home for the most part.  


Q:        [19:07] And do you own your own boat? 


A:        [19:09] Yes, yes.  It was my grandfather's boat.  He passed and I – oh my God, it was such a God thing.  It was crazy.  My grandfather passed and I got my license the same year that he passed.  And I was – I was, grandma, you got to sell me this boat.  Don't sell this boat to anybody and she yeah – she worked with me to be able to buy the boat so I could fish it and keep it in the family.  And it was really awesome because he was the first one that gave me my first stern man job when I was 12 or 13 and it was on the same boat.  So it was just kind of bittersweet how everything happened.  And it was just  – yeah, it was a God thing.  It was just so so ironic.  


Q:         [20:16] Yeah, wow.  Thank you for sharing that..


A:        [20:18] Yeah.  Yeah, you’re welcome.  


Q:        [20:19] And you mentioned wanting to diversify.  Can you talk a little bit about that and your impulse to do that?  


A:        [20:25] Yeah, well like I said before, the lobstering industry was under threats and there was new regulations being put in place and that made me really nervous about what the future is going to hold.  Not only just for me, but especially for my son.  And if he's going to be able to make a living lobstering, I mean, you see the, the prices of things nowadays and inflation's gone up so much.  And it's not like it used to be.  It costs so much.  Just to do this, just to live like this, just to have this lifestyle.  It's a lot.  I just don't know if financially he would even be able to do it, so I went into oyster farming because that seemed promising.  


And I just kept thinking about my grandfather and he actually used to own a fish weir before he started lobstering.  And the fish started to decline.  And back then we had a lot of great white sharks and other sharks in the area.  They're – that's how the ocean is.  One species thrives and then the other one kind of falls off a little bit and then this species runs out of food because they've eaten it all up and so they start dying and then another population will start growing again.  That's just kind of the cycle we've seen.  And so he just realized that the fish were kind of on the decline and a shark actually got into his fish weir and ate up all of his fish.  And after that he was, OK, I'm going into something else.  What else can I do to keep working on the water because he loved it.  


And he went into lobstering and it's – ironically my oyster farm is in the river that he first started fishing.  So this, yeah, it was really really cool.  But he started fishing out of the Weskeag River and then he moved on to South Thomaston and then he moved on to Criehaven, which is an island that's farther away offshore next to Lake Matinicus.  And he, he fished out there for the remainder of his life.  So that's why my boat actually – I kept the name Shearwater because he named his boat after his favorite ocean bird and it still says Criehaven as the port because I'm just not going to change it.  So I don't know, maybe I'll end up out there someday, probably not.  I have way too much going on in here between oystering and lobstering, so probably not, but I still to keep it the same.  


Q:        [23:30] And do you have any experience in bookkeeping, bait or gear preparation? 


A:        [23:35] Gear preparation, a lot.  Yeah, a lot.  Accounting was – I was very good at in school.  Math and science were definitely my best subjects in school.  I was terrible at English and history and still am.  But math came very easy to me.  So I had, I had no problem with that at all.  


Q:        [24:06] What about processing and trade?  I'd love to talk a little bit about where we're sitting right now.  


A:        [24:11] Yeah, so processing, I basically just did my research, I just did my research and found out that this is what I needed in order to get my seafood dealers license.  And I called up a friend of mine who was a carpenter, a very good one, and he was, yeah.  I showed him my shop and I was can you turn this into what I need you to turn it into and told them what it needed.  And he's, yeah, he’s, I can do it very easily.  So I did this and yeah, it works.  It's working good for now.  I don't know how much bigger I'm going to get.  I did put in an application to expand my farm.  It got denied because one of the landowners unfortunately didn't want to see any oyster farm equipment from her home.  


Yeah, she thought it was going to affect her being able to sell her house someday.  It would devalue her property and I – and she had some Airbnbs there.  And I was this is probably going to draw people to your property, not affect it negatively in any way.  But she still didn't see it that way and as far as the laws go right now, they have a say.  They have a say if you're close enough to their property line, then they have a say.  So that kind of backfired on me and I got a little bit discouraged.  


So I thought, well, instead of expanding, why don't I just try to maximize what I can. maximize at my lease site now and try to make it work the most efficiently and the best that it can.  And then we'll go from there.  So if I do put in another expansion it will be close to home.  I don't want to travel very far.  I can't, it wouldn't work for me.  So, but yeah, we'll see.  We'll see in the next year or two or three.  I don't know.  I take it one day at a time.  :


Q:        [26:39] Sure.  And do you have any experience in activism or community-based organization related to fisheries?  


A:        [26:44] I've worked a little bit with the MLA.  I've done some marketing with them,  collaborating with them a little bit.  I was happy to do it.  I was happy to learn.  I think everything that you do is a learning experience and the more that you put
yourself out there, the more that you meet new people which is awesome because
what else am I going to do? (laughter) I've always been one of those people that likes to just keep progressing, I guess.  I like to feel I'm progressive.  So that was a great learning experience for me and it has certainly helped me with marketing my own product as well.  For sure.  


Q:        [27:35] Great.  And can you tell us what does an average day look like for you?  I know that's hard, but however you feel – feels right to answer it.  


A:        [27:43] Yeah.  Yeah.  So right now it's a little bit different than in the beginning because I've been able to grow my farm a lot more than what it was in the beginning.  I was putting a lot of time myself into the farm beforehand so I was working extremely long days.  But now, especially that I have a son and my farm is grown and I have three full-time employees and then when we really get into full swing I might even hire two part-time employees to help out.  And that frees up my time so I can spend some time at home with my son at night.  So my days start at four in the morning. I get up, I'm on the boat at five.  I'm lobstering – I schedule the, I usually do the deliveries if possible because I have to stay connected to the people and the restaurants that I'm working with.  I think that having a good personal experience with them is good for business.  And then they get to stay connected to the actual farmer, which is really good.  So I try to take at least one of the delivery days to deliver to local areas and right now we have two delivery days.  


And I bring my son along with me too.  So that’s really cool.  So we'll go out to lunch and we'll have a day together.  


Q:        [29:24] I love that.  


A:        [29:25] Yeah.  


Q:        [29:26] And do you feel like – or how do you feel like your background and/or identity sort of shapes your work in the sector? 


A:        [29:32] Yeah, I think that my background is, has definitely it has shaped everything.  There was – a lot of other, I guess, girls that grew up around here that didn't really necessarily get into fishing.  I mean, I remember when I was younger just feeling I didn't really fit in because I was really good at being a girly girl, but I was also really good at being a tomboy and fitting it with the guys too.  So I never really had  one group of people that I hung out with.  And, so I think that that helped me do this work, but I always kind of felt in between both.   You know what I mean?  It was OK, now I got to act girly girl.  OK, now we're going to be tough.  Now I'm going to be serious because if I'm not then people aren't going to take me seriously.  


So I don't mind throwing my hair up and just putting on mascara real quick and then I get a whole lot more work done when I'm not primping in the mirror.  But when I was in school, I was definitely doing my hair, doing my makeup, dressing very girly girl, so I think that just being able to kind of fit in with everybody kind of helped me be, I don't want to say successful, but it just helped me, I think, along the way.  


So some fishermen, I'm sure the old school ones look at me and they probably laugh because they're, what's this girl out here doing?  Why is she doing this?  Why isn't she just staying home and being a mom?  Well, it's because I like to work and I love my job and I love what I do.


Q:        [31:30] Yeah, great.  Thank you.  We're going to sort of shift into environmental changes. Can you tell me about any changes you've noticed in your time working on the water?


A:        [31:52] Yes, back in the ‘90s and after that, there was a lot of lobsters that were very close to the shore.  I mean, you didn't have to go way out and fish for lobsters.  You don't have to go chase them that far.  You could have a smaller boat and just kind of putt around inside and the lobsters were coming up to the doors, the traps were full.  And I just remember being in such awe about that.  And there was definitely a lot of lobsters around.  There's still a lot of lobsters around, but we've definitely got a lot more regulations put it in place for sustainability so they can continue to reproduce.  And that's really good.  Traps are not as full.  But the lobsters, they're just migrating in different locations, the water temperature’s different, the salinity’s different.  Everything is definitely changing.  You can see that.


Q:        [33:07] Yeah, and how is that sort of impacting what you do? 


A:        [33:14] I'm an inshore fisherman, I don't go fish offshore.  I have a 36-foot boat.  My boat is not a 48-foot boat.  And I've always been excited to be an offshore fisherman.  How cool would it be to be the first offshore woman fisherman around here?  It'd be awesome.  It'd be a dream come true.  I don't know if I'm going to get there, I'd love to.  But we'll see what happens in the fishery.  And it's a lot of money to invest in a boat and in more gear and more rope.  And to go that far out, it's a huge risk right now.  Because we have the six years and then we don't know what's going to happen with the lobstering industry.  So, yeah, we'll see.


A:        [34:22] Can you tell me a little bit more just about your thoughts on the future or what do you think is going to happen? 


A:        [34:29] I think that lobstering is going to become more industrialized.  A lot of fisheries in Massachusetts and New Hampshire – there's just only big boats, the big boats go out.  And there's not going to be a lot of the small time fishermen.  A lot of people have gotten out in the last few years because they want to be able to
sell their boat.  They want to be able to sell their traps.  They – if lobstering ends all of the sudden where's people going to sell their boats?  No one's going to want to
boat.  No one's going to need a boat, all of their hard earned money and investments just going to go down the drain.  


So, I think that, yeah, it'll be – it's very regulated.  I think that regulation is good.  I think conservation is good.  I'm in an agreement to that.  I think the reporting is just so much.  Though, I think, it's just a lot.  You have to track how many lobsters you catch, where you caught them.  I know they want to know where the lobsters are, but it becomes no secrecy.  There's no secrecy.  There's no – it's not going to be anything it used to be I feel like.  So a lot of the offshore boats that are fishing federally have to report every single day so we're probably going to have to do the same thing, which for me is a lot because I report oysters, I report elvers.  And now I'm reporting lobsters.  It takes a lot of time out of my day. 


Last year was the first year that we had to do the lobstering.  And they – you had to report every month.  And I'd go back through all my slips for the month and I'd be, OK, how many traps did I haul this day?  How many traps did I haul that day?  I don't know, I can't remember.  I have my poundage here.  Where did you fish?  I don't know.  I can't remember exactly that.  So I see why they’re making people report daily, but it's just, it's a lot.  I'm just going to have to make it a part of your daily routine.  So it's – I accept it, but it's a lot.  Yeah.


Q:        [37:19] And have you seen any environmental change on your oyster farm or when you're fishing for elvers?


A:        [37:24] I haven't seen too much of an impact on my oyster farm.  My oysters are doing great.  So there's nothing that I see that's going to affect them too much.  I do know we got a lot of rain this year so if that continues to happen, then that could be very bad because that'd be just closure after closure.  But I'm in a good area where it's very close to the mouth of the river.  So I'm very lucky where my farm is located and where my perch site is located, because it's literally pretty much in the ocean.  It's not way up in the river like a lot of farms have it.  And for them, if global warming continues and oysters get too hot, then that that can be really bad because they grow too fast.  So I think I'm in a good spot for that.  So I'm pretty hopeful.  


Q:        [38:32] Have you had any problems with green crabs?  We talked to a few other oyster farmers who have had some.  


A:        [38:36] Yeah.  Yeah, I have noticed that there are a lot of green crabs in the river.  I did talk to someone about maybe throwing some green traps out there.  And there is someone that is actually doing that.  I'm not sure if that's going to help.  He said that he never throws anything that he catches back into the river because I was really worried about them reproducting (sic) more and more and more, increasing the population.  But I think if we go about it the right way and do open up a fishery, then it could be helpful.  And then that would also be another product that people could sell on the market here in Maine for seafood, which would be good.  I just worry about, oh, if we're feeding them, then they're just going to keep growing and growing and growing.  


So I mean, it's kind of a double-edged sword.  You don't really know until you try, but if we don't do something, they're going to continue to reproducing.  So it's – you kind of got to do something.  So I think that a green crab fishery here would be helpful to oyster farmers.  Yeah.


Q:        [40:02] Sure.  And I'm curious, to that point, when you look at the changes you're seeing, what are other things you're doing to try to adapt to those?  You mentioned diversification initially.  Are there other things that you're really thinking about?


A:        [40:14] Yeah, well, I mean, I try to do my best here and fight global warming.  I think it's important.  And I think that, yeah, there's nothing we can really do about global warming.  But if we all work together and invest in clean energy sources like with  solar power I have on my roof to run my oyster shop and then that's helping.  If I put solar panels out on my float to run my tumbler, then that's helping.  Every little bit is helping.  So I think if people just focus on what they can do to work together, then there might be a chance that we'll be able to not stop it entirely, but help it.  Help fight it as much as we possibly can.


Q:        [41:04] And do you feel with the diversification with the solar panels, do you feel you're really equipped to move into the future? 


A:        [41:10] Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  I think that we're doing OK.  And I think we'll continue doing OK.  I do think about electric motors and how that could also be helpful.  That's something I'm working with, with the Island Institute.  Right now I have a tracker on my outboard and it's tracking how many hours I use my outboard so that they can have that information to try to build an electric motor that is sufficient enough to carry that workload, and so the battery can last as long as I need it to while I'm out there working.  So that's, that's, that's the next thing.


Q:        [42:03] Is there anything else that you really would like to try or have your hands in?


A:        [42:08] I think right now I'm pretty busy.  I originally wanted to go into mussel farming but it was too much of an investment for me in the beginning to do that.  And I realized that oyster farming was financially easier for me to get started into so that's why I went into that.  Kelp farming is also another new thing.  There is a couple of people doing it in this area and they're successful at it, but it's where do you put the farm, all that kind of thing.  You don't really want to cross their territory or (inaudible) them either.  So it's working out in our area anyways that they're doing kelp and I'm doing oystering.  But who knows if lobstering does go south, then, yeah, I'd probably, probably go into kelp farming as well.  I'd like to do it now, but it's just not going to work for me at my lease site, because we’re kind of intertidal.  


So, somewhat intertidal.  So you need a lot more water depth to grow kelp.  So, and the turbidity’ got to be just right.  And – so, yeah, there's experimenting with that too. 


Q:        [43:38] Sure.  And you mentioned the Island Institute.  I'm curious what other things you might have found useful and thinking about the future.  Some words I have that might help you think about that like resources, relationship, knowledge, trainings,  those sort of things.  What have you found that have really helped you as you do these things? 


A:        [43:56] Yeah, the Island Institute has been wonderful.  I mean, they work with island communities and they kind of pull together the resources for you so that they can help you go into what you want to go into.  So they're an absolutely wonderful resource and, they're also helping – broadband was something that was really big for them.  They were helping island communities with that, people who didn't have Internet service.  Let's see what else have they been helping with – I'm not sure and I'm not even sure if I answered the question correctly.  But, yeah, the Island Institute has, has just been wonderful.  They're good, good friends of mine, good people, good people that work there.  So – and great, great for this community as well.  


Q:        [45:06] Great.  


A:        [45:07] And what would we do without them? 


Q:        [45:09] And sort of as you look towards the future, what is your biggest concern for Maine's fisheries? 


A:        [45:15] My biggest concern for Maine fisheries is – well climate change is definitely number one is at the top of the list.  That's, that's huge.  That will affect, that can  affect everything.  Very concerned about wind, wind turbines.  As much as
it is a clean energy source, I don't think it's smart to put wind turbines in our oceans, because it will destroy our bottoms.  It will destroy a lot of species and  these species, we kind of rely on to make a living.  That's something I really worry about, yeah.
.
Q:        [46:03] And if you could talk to policymakers what would you tell them to really prioritize as they look towards the future? 


A:        [46:10] I would tell them to definitely prioritize going green, clean energy, but without destroying our oceans. That's very important.  I think a big one really here in Maine is also – there's a lot of older people here and there's not a lot of young people that live around here to be able to work in especially this area.  I've had many people that have wanted to work on the farm and they're I can't find a place to rent because it's all Airbnb.  And so living is – the cost of living is so high.  I really think that they should start taking a look at how they can help people afford to live around here and to find housing.  I think that's, that's really important.


Q:        [47:07] Great.  And I'm curious on the climate front.  Have you participated in any 
resilience trainings or  things  that, thinking about climate?


A:        [47:15] I haven't.  I haven't been in any trainings for that.  I'm just very aware of it.


Q:        [47:22] Sure, and on that front, what do you think would be useful for people, for other fishermen as you consider the future on a climate and resilience kind of front? What do you think would be helpful for that? 


A:        [47:35] As far as other fishermen go, I think – well, I think everyone should put solar panels on their houses.  We need to go green, but we need to do it without wind.  So I think if everyone kind of steps up and does that, then it will help everyone substantially because the more we protect Mother Earth, the more we protect ourselves and our fisheries.  


Q:        [48:04] Great.  And are there any other changes that are really impacting your work
that you want to talk about? 


A:        [48:08] No, no, not that I can think of off the top of my head.


Q:        [48:17] And can you tell me about any opportunities or real positive changes that you've experienced since you've been around the water? 


A:        [48:28] Positive changes on the water  –


Q:        [48:32] Or opportunities. 


A:        [48:33] – or opportunities.  Well, I mean, aquaculture was a great opportunity for me.  Kelp is a great opportunity, like I mentioned, green crabbing would be a great opportunity, especially for this new generation coming up because I see that being a need.  I think that the more that the ocean changes then we need to keep an eye on species that start cropping up like black sea bass.  They've been definitely seen – more numbers of them around here.  Different opportunities to create different industries here, I think is a good thing to keep an eye on.  


Q:        [49:21] And when you think about green crabs, what do you think that industry could look like?


A:        [29:25] I think it could be great.  There's a lot of green crabs around here.   I think that everyone, I mean, there's so many seafood markets and wharfs that could benefit from, something like that if, we all work together to do that.  


Q:        [49:49] And sort of as you look towards the future, what is your hopeful vision for
the future of Maine’s fisheries? 


A:        [49:54] I hope that we can all still fish and make living on the water.  I think it's really important for Maine’s small businesses and families to be able to continue
this way of life, because, what are we – like the last ones on the planet that are  still 
doing this kind of thing.  We’re all small owned private business owners and you just don't see that.  You don't see that anywhere.  Everything is industrialized. There are just – it is just big business.  So I think it's important that we keep Maine being the way life should be.


Q:        [50:39] Have you noticed any difference in women's participation or status in the fisheries over time? 


A:        [50:45] Yes, and it's such a relief to see.  I have seen a lot more women getting – working on the water and getting into industries like these, which is great, because like I said, when I was younger, there was, there was no other women and I just felt like  I'm the only one.  So it's really, really good to see that, but I think that equality is so important, and we're still a big minority.  And if we all work together and support each other then we can kind of fight that.  And I mean, honestly, I've gotten the most help from women.  I go get a boat loan, it's from a woman, my second boat loan was from a woman.  Women have just helped me so much and I definitely want to pay that forward.  


So it's important we all kind of stay together because, I'm not saying all men are against us, or anything like that.  The world is changing and it's wonderful, but there's still some people out there that don't like it.  I mean, someone said on, on Facebook the other day that it was abusive for a man to have – to be in a relationship where the woman makes more money than him.  And I commented on it and I was like, wait, how is that emotionally abusive if a woman is making more money than you?  It didn't make any sense to me and I realized it's just an ego thing, it's just all ego and I think that equality is important.


Q:        [52:42] Yeah, and you mentioned that with elver, when you were elver fishing, you took a woman out with you.  I'm curious, do you find that there are a lot of women who really want to get into fishing?


A:        [52:50] Yes, there is.  And I think it is important that women are let into the industry. I think that, yes, definitely.  I'm just going to stop there.  I can't express it enough.


Q:        [53:08] Yeah.  Great, and then I sort of moved through the, the guide pretty quickly so I'm curious if there's anything you wanted to share with us.  I know you were sort of on a time crunch so I wanted to move fast.  But if there's anything else you haven't mentioned that you'd like to talk about, I'd love to hear it.


A:        [53:19] Yeah, yeah.  I think that it's just important if you are a woman just to not let anyone try to bring you down or discourage you from doing what you want to do, because if I had listened to everyone in my life, tell me what not to do, then I would not be where I am today.  And I'm very happy where I am today.  So –


Q:        [53:44] Great.  Thank you.  Jess, do you have any questions before we –


Q:        [53:39] No, you guys got all.  Thank you.  


A:        [53:51] Yeah.  Yeah.  You're welcome.


Q:        [53:52] Great.  Thank you so much.  I will turn this off.


END OF FILE"
"24","Q:        [0:00] We like to start with just – how do you like to introduce yourself?


A:        [0:04] Katie Weiler.  Do you want pronouns?  She/her.


Q:        [0:08] Great, thank you.  And what year were you born?


A:        [0:11] 1990.  I actually had to think about that for a second. (laughter) 


Q:        [0:16] Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A:        [0:18] Yeah.  So I grew up in Camden, Maine, born and raised, all the way until I was 18 and then went off to college, but grew up lucky enough on the water – so sailing, all that fun stuff, recreating on islands around Penobscot Bay.  Yeah, that was my lucky childhood.


Q:        [0:41] Do you have any really fond memories or moments that stick out from that?


A:        [0:45] Yeah.  Our friend group – everybody was lucky enough to have some sort of like vessel.  And we would – when we were younger, all of the parents, obviously, and siblings and everyone, we would go out and then like raft up boats.  So we would have like five sailboats rafted together over in like Pulpit Harbor, and all the kids would be swimming and playing.  And it was just really fun childhood memories to look back on – hanging out with friends, all rafted up and jumping over to each other's boats.


Q:        [1:17] Can you tell me a little bit about your parents – maybe where they're from, what they did when you grew up?


A:        [1:23] Yeah.  So my parents were Outward Bound instructors on Hurricane Island.  That's how they came to Maine.  Neither of them are from Maine originally.  My dad is from Vermont.  My mom is from Connecticut.  And they've been there since the '70s.  My mom was a nurse for many, many years, but worked on Hurricane in the summers.  And then my dad ran Hurricane for many years before going into management consulting.


Q:        [1:49] So were you there a lot growing up?


A:        [1:50] Yeah, up until – my sister was probably there more than me.  He stopped working there I think in like the early '90s.  So I was young, but there's lots of pictures on the island, and it's one of those core memories where I feel like I remember a lot, but I don't know if it's also from just stories. (laughter) But we go a lot now.


Q:        [2:11] You just mentioned siblings.  Can you describe siblings you have?


A:        [2:14] Yeah, I have one older sister.  She now lives in Connecticut, but she's up in Maine for the summer with her two kids and her husband.


Q:        [2:21] Great.  And you mentioned both Hurricane Island and your recreational history, but I'm curious if you have any other family history on the water you want to mention – maybe that's with fishing or just with navigation, sailing?


A:        [2:33] Yeah, mostly on recreational boats.  Sailing a lot.  Grew up sailing like Optis and Turnabouts and 420s just in like our Camden Yacht Club program, so nothing crazy.  I wasn't in like regattas or anything.  But that was a fun group of friends I had in that.  And my mom's side has a history of fishing that I think is called angling, if that's the technical term – I'm not a big fisherperson – or that type of rod-and-reel fishing.  I didn't grow up rod-and-reel fishing too much, but we would kind of like – my dad and mom from Hurricane knew a lot of lobstermen and stuff like that, so we were definitely in and around the industry.  Growing up in Camden, Rockport, Rockland, lots of industry there.  Obviously, Vinalhaven and North Haven are really close.  And knowing people from there, just lots – I felt like I was kind of in and around the industry, but not like directly fishing.


Q:        [3:37] Can you describe that a little bit more for me and maybe the way it felt?


A:        [3:42] Oh.  I mean, I feel like my later teen years were kind of a tumultuous time in the fishing industry.  We had a lot of addiction in our high school, and a lot of that was correlated kind of with the fishing industry.  Now, I think it's a little bit different, but I can't speak to it fully.


        But I feel like I had – reading through the questions, one was like, would you want your kids to be in this industry?  And I feel like growing up, I would have been like, no way.  It can lead to such, you know, scary paths.  But also, what an amazing industry.  And I wouldn't want to live in a state that didn't have a commercial fishing industry, especially the lobster industry.  So I feel like there's ways around it.  And growing up looking at it, you kind of shift your views of like, OK, there's good ways and bad ways and all the ways in between.  And I think not being directly in it, but just looking at it from a bird's-eye view and knowing people in it, I just have had all sorts of views in my head that have shifted over the years.


Q:        [4:49] I'm definitely going to come back to those views.  But just sort of following along with family, I'm curious – you mentioned not really any direct fishing – with like commercial fishing.  Any relationships with people in your family or people very close to you who worked in other roles in fishing or aquaculture?  Maybe that's processing, working in canneries, that sort of thing.


A:        [5:09] No.


Q:        [5:11] Great.  And can you describe your educational background a little for me?


A:        [5:14] Yeah, like I said, grew up in Camden, just public schools all the way.  Went to college at – well, at first, I went to University of Denver, and then I transferred to University of Vermont.  And after school, I moved to Boston and did something that wasn't even the realm of my degrees, which was English and consumer and advertising.  So yeah, that's the extent of it.


Q:        [5:40] Great, thank you.  Are you married?


A:        [5:43] Yes, I am.


Q:        [5:45] Do you have any children?


A:        [5:46] No, but I'm pregnant. (laughter) 


Q:        [5:48] Congratulations.


A:        [5:49] Thank you.


Q:        [5:51] So sort of returning to the children question, I guess how are you feeling about the marine industry and that future maybe for your child?


A:        [5:59] Yeah, I mean, I feel good about it.  I obviously chose to do work in this industry and work adjacently very closely with certain parts of the aquaculture and fishing industries.  I think the working waterfront is something extremely important to our state and our economy and something we need to hold onto, and I can't have that view if I would say that I wouldn't want to know anybody in it or have my kids go into it.  So absolutely that would be totally fine and totally great.


Q:        [6:28] Great, thanks.  I'm going to sort of transition now away from demographic questions into questions more about your current role.  So sort of starting, how would you describe your role in the fishing or aquaculture industry in Maine?


A:        [6:33] Yeah.  So I founded a company in 2021 called Viable Gear that is working on a seaweed-based plastic replacement.  It's a traditional bioplastic, because it's chains of biopolymers.  But the word bioplastic has a lot of greenwashing behind it at this point, which is why we call it a plastic replacement.


        But the whole impetus of doing this and starting this company was that I had moved back to Maine in 2019.  And we were out on Brimstone, which is an island that I grew up going to.  It's uninhabited.  We would usually find some ghost gear out there.  Ghost gear is the plastic pollution from the fishing and aquaculture industry.  So we would find some things out there, but nothing crazy, like a few buoys and maybe some trash left behind by people who were there.  But this time during the pandemic, we had gone out and we found 121 pieces of trash.  It was like a number that's specifically stuck in my head, because it was also just like a really crazy amount of trash.  And it wasn't trash that people were leaving behind.  It was clearly stuff that had washed up.


        So I had been in the global plastic crisis, I guess, space as a side passion for probably three years at that point.  And it was also the same time that the Endangered Species Act was coming down really hard on the lobster industry, and they had to change their tensile strength and their breakage points and all of that.  So it was kind of a really good time for me to say, all right, how do we focus on ghost gear and plastic in the ocean while also coming up with a solution for this industry that is being unfairly, in my opinion, treated at this time – just in terms of all of the things that I'm sure you guys already know about.


Q:        [8:21] Sure.  So can you describe a little bit of the process of getting into the work and what that looked like?


A:        [8:26] Yeah.  I mean, at the time, I was working for a management consulting company, but decided to found this company on my own and worked in two jobs for a little bit, probably a year and a half to two years, but really was trying to figure out what was out there.  To me, I had figured – there's a paper out of the University of Tel Aviv that talked about turning seaweed into plastic, so I was like, great, somebody's probably doing this.  We'll just procure that and make gear out of it.  That was not the case.  There was people doing it on lab scale and writing papers about it, but nobody was really on the market with any product.  So then it was really like, how do I find a polymer engineer, materials scientist – because that's not my background.  It was a lot of kind of like searching for people who were interested or had time.  And again, it was like still trickling into – like definitely not out of the pandemic by 2021, early 2021.  So just the way we were working was different.


        But I ended up finding someone who was interested at the University of Southern Maine.  And we worked with – it's called their Composite Engineering Research Lab – for a little bit and pulled some students in through a grant.  That ended up being like helpful, but slow.  And they're great, but their background isn't in biopolymers.  So we ended up finding another consultant who had been in the seaweed industry for like 30-plus years.


        So it was really about networking and finding the right people to work on this project, but a lot of it was I got really into seaweed and how Maine can cultivate a lot of of seaweed and the impetus of where we were starting with cultivating seaweed.  And it has similar polysaccharide structure to corn, so, OK, they make PLA out of corn.  We can probably do this.  From there, we just kind of continued to ramp up and have a prototype at this point.  But yeah, that's kind of how I got into it, I guess.


Q:        [10:30] Yeah, it's so cool to hear about all of the different people that you're pulling into it.  Can you talk a little for me – so in total now, you've been doing this for how many years?


A:        [10:42] Three and a half years, I think, at this point.  Yeah, it's been a while.  So we're finally working towards pilot production in Sweden, which is really exciting.  It's been a journey of trying to do it in the US, which hasn't worked. (laughter) So here we are.


Q:        [10:58] Can I ask you to speak a little bit more about that?


A:        [11:00] Yeah.  The US doesn't have manufacturing industry in general anymore.  It is all mainly overseas.  Especially kind of the way that we're producing our material, it behaves similarly to a textile at this point.  We're also in a stream of R&D to turn it into a pellet so that it can be used really directly in plastic machinery that we currently have today.  But yeah, that industry just like isn't here.


        And I can't get into like too much detail about it, but I can kind of say it starts as a dope, which is similar to a goop, which is similar to Lyocell and Tencel and that type of cellulosic fabrics.  So that's kind of where we had to go, and it's just taken a while.  And working with universities just hasn't been something that has worked for us.  It works for a lot of people in the industry, which is awesome and really important.  We've had a lot of really great work with universities, but the speed of trying to like do feasibility trials with that just like wasn't working.  And again, the industry of it to try and find people to manufacture it wasn't here, so we went abroad.


Q:        [12:14] Can I ask – what is it like to go from idea to market?  Because it takes so long.  You have so much research you have to put in.  I'm curious like if you could describe just what that process has been like.


A:        [12:26] Oh, God, it's like tapping into my memory.  I feel like I try and like black that out on purpose.  But I feel like, yeah, it's – I mean, it's exciting and it's frustrating, and it's like one of those you have kind of all of the emotions tied into it.  Because you read about this thing that is happening, and clearly universities have done it, and then it just gets published and sits on a shelf.  I am someone who gets frustrated about that, because I'm like there's so many amazing ideas, especially in like sustainability and sustainable materials, that are out there that aren't commercialized, because the IP is sitting at universities.  That's totally cool, but also it needs to be in the world and spread out.  So I kept just being like, this has to be – this is clearly feasible.


        That was where a lot of the frustration was, but also a lot of excitement when you start working with people who know how to do it and are happy to help you and are already in that industry, which is this company Everything Seaweed and Colin Hepburn who we work with.  So yeah, it was kind of this journey of like, can we even do this?  I started with pretty low hopes of like, OK, somebody can do this, but can I find somebody to help me do this?  So I was like baseline.  And then from there, you kind of get excited when things start working, but then they don't work that well.  You know, it's this up-and-down journey of like, here we are pilot manufacturing, and that's pretty exciting.


Q:        [13:54] That's so exciting.  I'm curious – like what are the products you're really hoping to have on the market soon?


A:        [13:59] Yeah, I didn't even talk about that.  So I had said the impetus was like lobster industry.  What can we do?  Can we help with lobster warp in any way?  That is still a relatively – like pretty highly used, as in like reusable, as in like over many years it's used.  So people aren't throwing out their lobster warp every year and getting new stuff.


        Before I even started Viable Gear, I talked to a ton of people in the lobster industry and then a ton of people in the aquaculture industry, because I wasn't going to start something that people would just like not even use in the first place.  So I was actually really hesitant.  I didn't think that the lobster industry would be interested in a product that was biodegradable or anything different than what they were doing now, especially with all the pressure they had on them already.  But people were really open to the idea – not necessarily of the lobster warp, because it was too hard to even talk about all the changes that were happening with that already.  But we started talking about ropes, which then led to like, what's a lower-risk rope?  And it's usually twines that are used, but also you can make a bait bag out of twines.  So for us, we said, OK, great, bait bags.  We can help you guys with that easy.  Not easy, but easier than lobster warp.  So that was where a smaller piece of gear came into play.


        So our first product to market is a twine that can be used in the aquaculture industries to grow more seaweed, which reduces nylon twine that's being used today.  A lot of farmers kind of call it like the dirty little secret of the seaweed industry, because it is this like plastic that gets biofouled onto their longlines, and it's really hard to get off at the end of the season.  So that is really low-risk.  It's like four or five months in the water and that's it, and then it can start to biodegrade and like marine compost.


        That was really fun and exciting when we realized, OK, great, it doesn't have to be this like big, crazy piece of gear that we're replacing.  Also, if the twine works, then we make a bait bag out of it.  So that's where we're starting with twine, but the twine can also be used across industry.  The agriculture and farming industries use a ton of twine.  Everyone used to use hemp twine to tie up their tomatoes and stuff in greenhouses.  Now, most people are using nylon or polypropylene.  So we're going to also market to that industry.  But a twine is the first product, then bait bags, and then we can kind of go from there with some other meshes and stuff for the aquaculture industry or farming industry.  But we're starting with those two for now.


Q:        [16:38] God, that's so exciting.  I'm curious – when you were talking to all of these lobstermen, aquaculturists, were there any things that really surprised you from that or things you kept hearing?


A:        [16:48] Yeah, I think there's like a few things that surprised me.  One was kind of something I figured, but people were really open to – this isn't the part I figured.  People were more open to using a new material or something that was better or would help them be “better ocean stewards” if the cost was right.  That's kind of where I was like, OK, I figured cost was going to be huge – that people were like, yeah, if it costs the same as a current bait bag, we'll buy it.  Which I was like, great, that's awesome.  But I wasn't expecting them to be like, yeah, we'll try it for sure.  There was a bunch of people who were like, yeah, why wouldn't we just give it a shot?  If it doesn't fish as well, we won't use it.  But the goal is that we'll have it all tested before we market it as like exactly a bait bag at that point.  So we've been in touch with and have letters of support from the Lobster Institute, which is exciting, because they can do that testing for us.


        So it was like really around relationship building once you start talking to people – like, all right, how does getting a piece of gear into this industry work?  We just learned a lot about the industry.  But people were kind of excited about – like, oh, have you thought about this?  Or my question at the end of my customer interviews were always like, is there a piece of plastic or something that you use on your boats that you identify using the most that's like plastic?  Because I think a lot of people, including all of us in day to day – if you really think about it, you're like, oh, wow, that's a lot of plastic we consume.  But you might not be like, this is the number one and identify it the most.


        But like far and away, almost – I think it was like 90% of people said zip ties.  Aquaculturists, lobster, commercial fishing, scallop trawling, everyone was saying zip ties, which was really shocking to us.  And they were like, yeah, that's a really good idea.  Bait bags – we'll use that.  But have you thought about zip ties?  Oyster fishermen were like, have you thought about zip ties?  So that was the impetus of us saying like, OK, well, we're clearly hearing this.  So while we haven't thought about injection-moldable plastics, we need to go that direction at some point.  That's where the pelletizing of our material is going, so we can hopefully make zip ties for the industry.  Because that just wasn't wasn't on my radar.  Like I knew people definitely – grew up in an outdoorsy household.  My dad uses a lot of zip ties for sure. (laughter) But I hadn't thought about it really in commercial fishing, which was really interesting.


Q:        [19:19] And like with that, I'm curious – do you have like a fantasy large line of products, like I carry all these different things?


A:        [19:27] Yeah, there's definitely like a big future lineup.  But you know, other than kind of – like I'm such a take it one step at a time type person, because I feel like people can get out over their skis if they're like thinking too far in the future.  But I also think it's important.  So yeah, the lucky part is that with our twine, we can make a ton of products, including like landscape fabric, which is the black kind of plastic that goes over farmlands or in other landscaping uses.  But we can take our twine – and the idea that we've talked to people about is that you put that directly in a loom and it makes fabric.  So we could do a lot more products than we were thinking initially just by having the twine as like a baseline, which is really exciting.


        And then if we can get the injection-moldable plastic stuff, then zip ties are far and away our number one.  But there's a lot of stuff that's injection-molded that's really single-use.  And while our initial thoughts were that we were helping create solutions for food harvesters across the board who don't have other alternatives on the market right now, there's also a lot of injection-moldable plastic that could be really easy.  I mean, we think about things every day like buckles – literally like on your bike helmet, like that type of buckle.  It's not getting heavy wear and tear.  So there's just things like that.  We'll see where we go with it.  But the idea would be more like we make a specific set of products, and then we sell our pellets to companies who are making buckles and stuff like that.  So they take care of that and just procure the material from us.


Q:        [21:12] And in terms of production – as much information as you can share – where are you getting the seaweed to start doing this?


A:        [21:19] Yeah, so we are using all the types of seaweed that can be grown here, but we don't have a biorefinery in Maine or in the US, which is a problem.  And there's companies that are working on it, like Everything Seaweed, which is based here at the Ocean Cluster.  But we have to work with Ireland and Scotland and a little bit with Japan as well at this point, just because we can't take the raw seaweed and do what we need to do with it.  So that's kind of like a plus and a minus, which is our formula is proprietary and really amazing at this point, and we have fantastic inputs, but it needs to scale in the US.  And the only way it can scale in the US is if we have a biorefinery.


        So the goal is to use Maine-grown seaweed.  And we'll probably have to supplement with seaweed from elsewhere, just because we can only produce so much.  And so much of it is – well, like almost all of it is going directly into the food industry right now and like a little bit into fertilizers and stuff.  But yeah, we want to use Maine-grown. 


Q:        [22:23] Great, thank you.  I'm just going to kind of run through a bunch of questions that you just can answer as it feels, right?  Do you hold any licenses?  So that could be commercial fishing licenses, any other.


A:        [22:36] No.


Q:        [22:38] Great.  Do you own a boat?


A:        [22:39] No.


Q:        [22:40] I'm going to ask you a few questions about your experience in the industry beyond fishing or harvesting.  If anything comes up, please – do you have any experience in bookkeeping, bait, or gear preparation?


A:        [22:55] No.  I feel like maybe gear preparation in terms of like lines and stuff, but probably like technically no – of what you're thinking.


Q:        [23:04] Thank you.  What about post-harvest processing, marketing, or trade?


A:        [23:09] Marketing, yeah.  And I have done a lot of seaweed harvesting – or not a lot, but I've gone out a few times to harvest seaweed, which is really fun.


Q:        [23:20] Can you talk a little bit about that experience?


A:        [23:23] Yeah.  I mean, getting into this industry, I wanted to learn every aspect of it.  So part of that was talking to as many seaweed farmers as I could, and a lot of that was also saying like, can I come out and check out your farm and harvest with you?  People do it in all sorts of different ways.  It's similar to the lobster industry.  And just a very Maine-type thing, where everyone has come up with some type of technique that works for them or in their size farm and all of that.


        I've been mostly on smaller farms, so it's a lot of hand-cutting and stuff.  To me – and maybe this isn't because it's my job, or maybe people who do it for a living still feel this way – but I feel like a day out on the water when you hit it right on like a nice, sunny day, even on like a cold April day, is still pretty lovely to be out there just – I mean, tediously cutting seaweed, but it was kind of fun, because I got to see that side of the industry.  And then you bag it and it goes to – it gets picked up by the processor and goes from there.


Q:        [24:24] How do you think those experiences informed the way you interact with the work now?


A:        [24:32] I mean, I think it's so important when you're going to be part of an industry to know or experience all sides of it.  So again, like I've been on a lobster boat before.  I think it would be kind of weird, maybe, to grow up in coastal Maine if you haven't been.  But I think it's important to see all sides of it and know all of the people from – I don't like the term top to bottom, but it's like east to west of the industry.  You can't really understand all facets of your job unless you know kind of like where everyone is in that industry and where people are coming from.


        So learning what was really hard for the seaweed farmers was when we decided to like – hey, well, we can make a twine.  And we would never have thought – like replace the nylon twine that's used in seaweed nurseries.  Like it's really niche, but it's also used globally to grow seaweed.  And it's not something I would have known about unless I started really talking to nurseries and started talking to Atlantic Sea Farms off the bat and stuff like that where it was like, what are your problems?  What plastic are you using that we could help you replace?  So coming at it from the solutions lens and just talking to as many people as possible I think is always really important.  And I definitely don't think I would like be where we are today without talking to so many people across the seaweed industry, including farmers, mostly.


Q:        [25:56] And do you have any experience in – and I feel like probably a lot – in research and development when it comes to these kind of things and being in the process of that?


A:        [26:07] I guess now I do.  I did not have a background in R&D at all.  But I kind of just like – day by day, you know, you figure out – what do we need to do?  What are your milestones?  Like if you set the right goals with the right timeline, I feel like you can kind of chip away at getting to any – like wherever you need to go.


        So my background was in marketing and management consulting in terms of building strategies for companies and helping teams kind of work towards goals within those strategies.  I feel like that was really helpful for me to say, where do we need to go?  And in order to get there, what do we need to do?  Working backwards has always been really helpful for me.  And yeah, I guess I have background in R&D at this point.


Q:        [26:55] Thank you.  What about any background in food prep or consumer interface?


A:        [27:01] No.  I guess consumer interface from like a marketing lens of things, but not directly from like the food lens.  And then food prep just because I worked in catering for a thousand years. (laughter) But that's it.


Q:        [27:19] Great.  And what about in advocacy or community-based organization related to fisheries or aquaculture?


A:        [27:24] Yeah, so related to fishing and aquaculture, I'm on the board of Saltwater Classroom, so that's marine education and like an ocean-based curriculum for kids.  I always say starting young is how we're going to make change, especially policy change.  And all of the things that we need to really do is like education at a young age.  So I believe that kind of like goes across that whole swath of everything, really.


        But then I'm also on the board of Hurricane Island.  So that's also kind of like marine programmatic – and there's a lot of aquaculture work and research happening on Hurricane which is really exciting, and they just built a big research station.  So hopefully more research and education can come off of that island.  And I think it's really cool to have that just like in the center of Penobscot, where people can really tap into it and make actual changes that need to happen in that area.


Q:        [28:18] That's awesome.  Thank you.  And then this question I think is going to be really hard to answer, but what does an average day of work look like for you?


A:        [28:25] Oh, yeah, that is hard to answer.  At one point, it was me in the lab a lot doing just like compounding work and messing around with material formulas and stuff like that.  I feel like now it's a lot of – we're in a raise, so a lot of trying to figure out what that looks like for us in terms of talking to the right people for fundraising.  And that is not my favorite thing, but that's OK.  We have been grant-funded up until now.  So at one point, again, it was a lot of grant writing and stuff like that.  It changes based on what we're doing with the company – a lot of managing and trying to work through legal documents based on the partners that we're working with and all of that, just like good business operations stuff that is not the fun and sexy, but you have to get it done to get work done a lot.  So yeah, it changes based on the day.  That's not a good answer, but – 


Q:        [29:29] But I can imagine you probably have so many different hats that you have to wear and think about.


A:        [29:33] Yeah.  Luckily, I have a great COO.  She lives in California.  So she's kind of like our West Coast arm, which is cool, too, because I think it's great to kind of say we're across the US, if you will.  But yeah, that has helped a lot – which is like hire the right people who can really help progress your business, for sure.


Q:        [29:55] You mentioned being pregnant.  If you don't mind sharing it, I'm curious – how do you think that will affect what the average day looks like for you, or how are you thinking about that as you look forward? 


A:        [30:06] Just like stress and anxiety, basically, when you own your own company and like – what does that look like?  Because yeah, of course we don't have that stuff in place, especially as the CEO.  It's like, OK, well, who knows what this will look like come February, but we'll see.  So I guess it's really just like thinking about it and then trying not to think about it a lot of time to actually get work done, because it can be a lot.  But we'll figure it out.  We'll come up with a plan.


Q:        [30:36] Thank you so much.  And then how do you – or do you feel like your background or identity shapes your work in the marine industry in Maine?


A:        [30:45] Yeah, I think that's a good question.  I think if I hadn't grown up on the water and kind of like knowing what the marine industry looks like or basically knowing what it looks like to even be someone who's like out on the water, let alone making their living on the water, and knowing especially just like really good friends of mine who were directly in that industry, I think I would kind of be like – I don't know if clueless to it is like the right word, but I don't know.  It's so hard to articulate what it's like to like grow up in coastal Maine and grow up near the working waterfront without being in it.  Because I'm sure you talked to so many people who grew up in the working waterfront, which is very different from growing up adjacent to it, which is also very different from growing up like not at all – like inland Maine or not even in Maine, you know?


        So I think it's – I'm not like the best at articulating this stuff anyway, but yeah, I think I don't even know what I would know if I didn't know what I know.  You know what I mean? (laughter) It's just such an interesting thing to grow up thinking that you know something about something and then not being in it.  I don't even know if this is something I would have done.  You know what I mean?  I think if I didn't grow up on the coast, would I even care as much about ghost gear impacting things?  And then I also like have endocrine issues and grew up eating a ton of local seafood, and I'm like, OK, so like did micro- and nanoplastics in our food system have anything to do with the endocrine disruptors that I might have had, or was that genetic?


        There's so many public health things, too, around what we do and the why that it's so intertwined.  It's hard to really see where that would be without going to an island and seeing the ghost gear.  I had kind of been spinning my wheels on getting out of the industry and the job that I was in anyway.  So if I hadn't been on my parents' boat up in the Midcoast, able to go out to an island, would I even be doing this?  I don't know.  So you can untangle that web of an answer at some point. (laughter) 


Q:        [32:56] That's great.  And I'm curious – do you think there's a gendered element to the work at all?  Do you feel like that affects your – 


A:        [33:01] That's a good question.  Yeah, that's a good question.  I haven't thought about that other than women founders and CEOs don't get a lot of funding.  It's like 2% of the funding that's out there.  I know that has a lot to do with the work day to day that I'm in, just being a startup.  And a lot of the time around the blue economy, I do feel like I'm certainly in the minority as a woman.  I'm certainly in the minority as a woman founder.


        I don't know if it affects how I got into the work at all, but I feel like being a woman in our society has an effect on everything.  That's how I am the person I am today.  And that's why I feel like people think I'm kind of a tough asshole sometimes, is because when you grow up in the business world and corporate America, when you're a younger woman in a boardroom, you kind of unfortunately take on a lot of hypermasculine traits that get you promotions or get you whatever, because you're conforming with the typical.


        I feel like founding your own company, it's really interesting to try and shed some of those to be like, OK, we don't need to be assholes.  Let's be nice.  I mean, I generally hope I'm a nice person, but there's just certain things where that just becomes ingrained in you in your 30s to be in this society as a woman and especially coming out of business.  I feel like a lot of people don't think about that.


        And I think ageism is something that we don't talk about a lot, and ageism is really huge in corporate America, and it can really affect you.  So I definitely see myself sometimes working with younger people and I'm like, OK, how do you not be a – just like let's incorporate everybody.  But then there's still that element of like, OK, but you also just don't know stuff at that age.  So it's like a really interesting balance.  I think I'm learning a lot of my biases that I know I have, but also I feel like I am kind of aware of certain things that have impacted where I am today.


Q:        [35:06] Thank you so much.  And we've been talking to women who are in a lot of different places with family.  So this question is thinking about gender and expectation.  How do you feel your work interacts with any family or caregiving responsibilities you might have or have in the future?  You spoke to the pregnancy already.  Is there anything you maybe wanted to add?


A:        [35:28] Yeah, it's just like a whole mind spin – spiral at this point, I think, around it, because it is like a – I think our family structure is a little more fluid, maybe, than other ones.  I feel like my husband and I aren't stereotypical as much of like – I don't know.  I'm not going to place any stereotypes.  But I feel like he is also open to being like, OK, I can do childcare, or I don't have to – I mean, again, in our society, I would love to be at home with a kid, and I think some women don't think that.  But I'm like, that sounds really kind of cool to get to watch your kid grow up.  But then there's also so many gender stereotypes around people who are like, oh, so you don't want to have a job?  And I'm like, that's not what I fucking said.  But I want to raise my child, you know?


        So there's weird things like that all just going through my head right now of like, I don't know what it's like yet, but I've watched people – a lot of my friends do it, and it seems like really fucking hard.  And that's all that I have to it at this point – which is like I don't have any answers as to what it's going to look like.  I just know it's going to be hard.  And like, yeah, I'm however many – like 11 weeks, and they're like, you should definitely be on lists for a preschool at this point.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  That's crazy.  But that's just what it is in Portland specifically.  I think it's easier in other communities, maybe, to get childcare.  But here, it's really hard.  So unless one of us, my husband or I, decide to leave our jobs or do things really differently, it's just going to be tough.


Q:        [37:06] Thank you so much for sharing.  I'm going to sort of transition to questions about environment – just like environmental change.  Because you've talked to so many people and you're kind of interestingly positioned, feel free to interpret these a little bit differently.  Can you describe any changes in the marine environment you've noticed or like have come up a lot?


A:        [37:27] Yeah.  I mean, I think this goes back to just like growing up on the coast of Maine, because I notice differences all the time.  Growing up, we had to wear like flip-flops or Tevas on the beach.  Otherwise, you'd step on a sea urchin.  Now, it's really rare to see one.  So that's just like how it is.  And it's really interesting that even in my 30-plus years that I've noticed something so impactful like that.  Like it truly was something of my childhood – which was like pulling sea urchin spikes out of my feet, you know?  And now, again, that's not a thing at all, which is really interesting and sad and total environmental change.


        But I've also noticed, just because of the space I'm in, more plastic places.  And again, this isn't a negative on the industry, because they've had to make these changes, but the more breakage points you have in your lines, the more ghost gear you're going to have.  Because if something hits that breakage point, then you have just like free-floating line in the water.  So yeah, there's just like more rope versus buoys and stuff that I've seen out there.


        And then oddly enough, this year we've heard of bait bags being ripped out by seals more than ever.  I kind of thought that was like – huh, what a weird little fact that I heard.  And then I was on the phone with someone yesterday who said the same thing.  They were like, oh, yeah, apparently the seals are ripping bait bags out more this year.  I don't know what type of environmental change that is, but it seems like they're figuring that out or are like more desperate for food or like – I don't know what it is.


        But there's definitely a lot of change that – let alone just like you put your foot in the water, and it's warmer.  That might be something different that's like down here in southern Maine, and I grew up up in the Midcoast, so the water temperature is different.  But down here, I'm like, this is crazy.  This is not Maine ocean water, you know?  It's like warm.  So yeah, that's my general viewpoint.


Q:        [39:28] Yeah, absolutely.  And I'm curious how that's informed by all the people you talk to.  Do you feel like you have like a really – 


A:        [39:34] Yeah, I feel like it's all over the place.  Aquaculturists specifically I talk to a lot just still, because they love to check in and kind of like see where we're at, because they're kind of in the camp of like, do you have this like yesterday?  Versus like, OK, cool, let us know when you have it out.


        And I don't know if I have taken away anything other than like the warming water.  Everybody kind of talks about the water being warmer.  Everyone's impacted by storms.  Like a ton of people lost a lot of their gear last year, obviously, across fishing industries and aquaculture industries, but a lot of oysters were gone, even if they were sunk.  That's just like a lot of water moving around to not lose gear when you sink your oyster farm.


        And Hurricane was – the island was impacted by the storm.  So I'm definitely part of places that have had major storm impact.  And then you have to have like major infrastructure work.  As many people know, infrastructure work on an island is really fucking hard.  You have to have like barges and all of that stuff come out.  Like it's not as easy as just like hiring a company to come grate something.


Q:        [40:48] Yeah.  And in terms of how those things are really influencing or impacting it – I know that is a huge impetus behind starting it, but I'm curious if there's anything else you wanted to describe.


A:        [41:01] No.  I feel it – well, maybe, and I'm just not thinking of it.  But definitely an impetus of why Viable Gear exists is because of all the impacts of environmental change and plastics and – you know, a big believer in the fact that nothing's going to change unless policy changes around plastics.  And when we talk about plastics, we really need to talk about the oil industry.  I think a lot of people kind of like don't know or think about the two being connected.


        Yeah, I think that there's just like a lot of environmental impacts that when we talk about ocean plastics need to go back to fracking in the Ohio Valley.  And that's really hard for people to make that exact – like, oh, wow.  OK, this piece of plastic is because of like X, Y, Z.  Or where did this even come from initially?  Or we're piping things from like Louisiana's Cancer Valley – or Cancer Alley, sorry – all the way up to some crazy plastic production plant in like Mississippi.  So it's like things moving all over, piped all over.


        I just think there are so many more environmental impacts that are impossible to even  get into at this point from like finding one piece of plastic in the water or having to use plastic.  That's how I want to frame it always is like there's not other solutions right now unless you go back to like hemp or cotton line, and people don't want to do that because they don't think it works as well.  Maybe that's true, maybe that's not.  I'm not here to decide that, because I don't know.  I can read as much as I want about it.  But people are just used to using plastic at this point, and people are used to being like a to-go, quick society.  So unless you change your mind frame and your entire habits – which you can do, but it's really hard, and people have other shit to worry about.


        But I did that whole like plastic-free, low-waste journey, and it's hard and stressful.  It impacts your health and impacts so many other things.  Because you can't really buy produce not in plastic in certain places.  Yeah, I think there's so many rabbit holes to go down to unpack a lot of that, but I'm sure it impacts my day to day more than I think about it.


Q:        [43:21] Sure.  And with Viable Gear and using that as a way to adapt to all of these different things and working in these huge systems, I don't know, I'm just curious – how does that feel, or how is it working in that space?  What fuels that movement?  Does that make sense?


A:        [43:39] Yeah, I feel like I'm in therapy.  I'm bad at articulating my emotions.  I'm like, I don't know how that feels. (laughter) It feels like something, I'm sure.  Yeah, I mean, I think this – I can only speak to myself.  This all started with probably some serious eco-anxiety.  When you really learn about what is going on with plastics and how it's impacting the oceans – and not even our oceans, but like our soil health and all of that.  A lot of it leads to ocean health, of course, but any species is impacted.  And any plastic that ends up in the water is impacted by the UV light in the marine environment and it breaks down.  The more you know, I feel like the more you kind of get stressed about it.  I feel like then some people are just like, oh, God, I can't think about this.  And then some people like me are like, nobody's doing enough.  I have to do something about it.  And that can just change the trajectory of your life.


        So it feels like I learned too much to not do it.  Like I kind of got to a point where I was like, I kind of have to do this, because I don't know what else to do about knowing all of this information.  And it's also fun and exciting to work on this, of course.  I think, like catch me on a different day, and I might say something different.  But I really do love the work, and I do it for a reason, for sure.


Q:        [45:09] Thank you.  And as you look towards – I know you're still designing, and the product's not on the market yet.  But do you really – like I'm curious – do you think it's really going to help?  Do you think it's going to move things in a new direction?


A:        [45:21] Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely not naïve enough to think it's going to change the world, but I think it's a start.  And I think the more that people can work on this, the more that there will be large changes.  And I hope that – I mean, of course it's like, you do this work because you hope it is a big change, but you have to start small.  And I've always been like – you know, it's like the people who are trying to go plastic-free in a day.  Like you can't do that.  You literally have to go like day by day.


        So that's where it's like us starting with a small product.  We're like, OK, we're going to tackle nylon twine used in the seaweed industry and used on farms – like pretty small.  I mean, not small markets, like relatively pretty large, but a small product.  So let's hope that small product gets traction.  And again, we wouldn't have – or I wouldn't have founded this unless I had talked to people who were like, that sounds awesome, and we would use that, and we would buy it, and we're happy to help you test it and all of that stuff.


        So I feel like especially being back in Maine and starting Viable Gear in Maine has been wonderful.  Like it's been a very supportive startup community, very supportive blue economy startup space where people are just like, how can we help?  And so many people have like – oh, you should talk to this person.  You should talk to that person.  So I feel like it just was a really good time and a really good space to get into this.  And some people tell us we're ahead of the game.  You know, everyone has their own opinion.  So let's hope we make a difference a little bit, at least with a few people.


Q:        [46:57] Yeah, you've mentioned, I think, a lot of people you're working with and drawing on.  This is like a list of things that may inspire things and that.  But I'm curious – are there anything that you're really drawing on – maybe that's resources, relationships, knowledge, training, or organizations – that are really helping you as you're doing this work?


A:        [47:14] Yeah, everybody.  Like more heads are better than one.  Like I'm just one person who doesn't have a background in this.  So I am definitely more on that guise of like we wouldn't be where we are without so many people.  And I think I've probably already mentioned most of the people that we really rely on, but if we hadn't found Colin and his background in the seaweed industry and me feeling like I pressured him into doing consulting for us – I was like, please, please, please work with us – that we wouldn't be where we are today with our material.  That's also because he knew about other seaweed inputs and stuff that I might never have come across.


        And then we're working with the Roux Institute on like pelletizing our material because this wonderful person, Bill, moved here from Chicago because his wife got a job.  It's like things just fall into – not fall into place.  I'm kind of one of those people that's like, you kind of make your own luck, or like you find your own luck or whatever.  But things with Viable Gear have been really awesome in terms of like – you work really fucking hard to find people, and sometimes it takes you like a month, and sometimes it takes you like years, and that is a struggle.  But hopefully by the time you find that person, it's the right person or the right space in it.  Yeah, so there's so many people we rely on.  I would say like we're sitting in the Ocean Cluster right now.  Without the Ocean Cluster, I doubt I would be where I am today.  Their network has been amazing.


        I was part of an accelerator right at the start that was called the Seafood Sprint with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and Gulf of Maine Ventures, and then SeaAhead in Boston, and their networks were indescribably amazing.  And it was kind of at the same time I was working at the Ocean Cluster.


        So I feel like I was lucky enough to plug into a lot of resources and places that really jumpstarted and accelerated me talking to so many people.  Because I knew lobstermen, but I didn't know any seaweed farmers.  And I could kind of figure out how to get people's contacts, but there's nothing better than a warm lead or a warm email being like, hey, you should talk to Katie who's starting this company, and then people will respond.  So I was just lucky enough or maybe bullish enough to kind of like fight my way into all of these different, really wonderful incubators and accelerators that have helped so much along the way.


Q:        [49:46] Thank you.  And you spoke a lot to this already, but if there's anything you wanted to add – I'm curious – as you look towards the future, what are the next steps?


A:        [49:54] Yeah, the next steps are really – like focusing on a raise and getting our pilot production going.  It's kind of like what my main focus is right now.  But the ultimate goal is to have a product on the market by 2025.  We are working with some amazing seaweed farms and hopefully land farms as well to test our material in 2024 – end of 2024.  And that's if everything goes well at this production place in Sweden, so let's hope.  But I always kind of keep my hopes baseline to low so they get exceeded, where it's like I'm sure something will come up where that timeline might be thrown.  So we're ready for that, but that's kind of the focus right now is really – like we've done what we needed to do lab-wise, and we've applied to a ton of grants, and we've been funded non-dilutively until now.  And all of those are big and impressive things at this point, but we need to make the jump a little bit further or just like really getting a product to market for me.


Q:        [51:07] Great.  And what is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future of Maine's marine industry?


A:        [51:13] Oh my God, that's a big question.  Biggest concern about Maine's marine environment?


Q:        [51:21] Yeah, or maybe like a different way to frame that question, if this is useful, is like, if you could tell like a policymaker, for instance, or just like a person in power, what should be like a big priority for that person thinking about the marine environment?


A:        [51:34] I have so many, I feel like.


Q:        [51:36] You can list many.  You don't need to give me one.


A:        [51:38] Yeah, I mean, they're probably all tied together, but also like separately at the same time.  Because obviously where I am day to day, I'm thinking about plastics in our marine environment and cleaning up our food system.  And how do we come up with policies that help people implement solutions versus make people feel like they're forced into solutions?  Also, putting plastic policy in place when you don't have solutions is not helpful.  Like there has to be these solutions first.  So I think it's really focusing on R&D around new and innovative materials and then new and innovative ways to do things.


        Like Abby Barrows' farm, Deer Isle Oysters – look, they're doing really awesome things with plastic-free gear, and they're not using new material.  I mean, they are with like the MycoBuoys and stuff like that, which is also a wonderful company – MycoBuoys – that makes the mycelium-based buoy replacements.


        But I think it's just being innovative and not afraid to kind of have the state say, let's actually focus on this.  Because I feel like people are supportive, but no one's putting their money where their mouth is.  So there's a lot of support and not a ton of funding and just like a funding gap around really good ideas and then getting those good ideas to market.


        But I also think – like big proponent of we need the lobster industry to stay around.  And also while it can, unfortunately – just like we've seen the shift more Down East in lobster – and I'm definitely not a marine, whatever, biologist – (laughter) can't even think of that word – but you hear people talk, and I think it's pretty clear that things are moving north, Down East.  I don't know what that means for the lobster industry.  But I think while the lobsters are here, we need to be really supportive of the industry and supportive across all of the industries that are really important to our state and more kind of getting back to the roots of – like we don't have processing plants here anymore.  And talking to people who are working on canneries and stuff, and it's like the closest cannery's in like New York or something crazy like that.  We used to be a state that had hundreds of canneries up and down the coast, and the fact that there's not one between here and New York is crazy.  So how do we just bring industry back to Maine that's going to really help Maine thrive?  I think that includes everything within the marine environment.


        And also definitely not against the Environmental (sic) Species Act – because I feel like it does sound like I am sometimes – but also we want our really important marine ecosystem.  So I think there's a huge balance of how do we do both?  And I'm also a proponent of – like I think there's a way to do both, where we like figure out new technologies to track whales and do that really responsibly and protect our marine environment and protect the species there, but also protect people who are working on the waterfront.


Q:        [54:55] Great.  Thank you for that answer.  That was awesome.  Have you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation trainings for fishing and aquaculture?


A:        [55:02] I don't think trainings.  I've done Sea Grant's whatever – it's called like the working waterfront program or whatever.  But I wouldn't consider that like a resiliency program.


Q:        [55:18] What strategies do you think would be effective for building resilience on the coast?


A:        [55:25] Oh, I don't know if I'm the right person to speak to that.  I feel like we're doing a lot of rebuilding from the storms right now.  And if we do that a little more thoughtfully, I kind of – and again, I don't know about it enough to say people aren't doing it more thoughtfully.  I'm sure people are.  But like thinking about materials that are used and longevity of them, or like, OK, if they are going to break apart, what are they made of?


        And I think cost to all of this is really important, especially for the people who these aren't like their second and third and fourth and fifth summer homes.  Like those people should definitely be using more sustainable materials that – like if their dock is blown apart, let's like not make it a plastic dock.  Let's make that wood.  Stuff like that that I feel pretty strongly about, but also don't know enough about to really speak to it eloquently.


Q:        [56:26] Thank you.  That was a good answer.  Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes you've seen in your time doing this work?


A:        [56:34] Yeah, I feel like I see positive stuff all the time, which is exciting, and that's what's part of keeping me and I think a lot of us going, which is – again, I mentioned Abby and the work that she's doing.  We were just on a podcast that came out I think like today or yesterday from the Island Institute and Galen.  I feel like there's people doing really awesome work towards this.  And Maine keeps it really small.  Like Abby's done an amazing job or people have done an amazing job picking up her work and kind of expanding that outside of Maine.  I think we need more of that, because there are some really cool companies here and in Massachusetts, too.  Like there's people working on really cool smart buoys that will help farmers and stuff like that that are important and exciting to see.  Because if there's going to be all this crazy technology, we might as well use it for good, not for evil, because – like I don't do that.  But yeah, I'm also just an advocate of putting money into our world versus like blowing holes in our ozone.  So I feel like when I talk about funding, then I'm also like, OK, let's like bring it back to our ocean and figure out how to like make our world healthy.  So yeah, there's a tangent off of that, but – 


Q:        [57:48] That's great.  And I'm curious – what is your real hopeful vision for the future?


A:        [57:55] Oh my gosh.


Q:        [57:57] Or Maine's marine industry, I guess, specifically.


A:        [57:59] Yeah, I mean, I feel like I've always been like – I feel like everybody can use our waters and get along, and I still feel that way.  You know, there's always been funny rivalries out on the water from like the dawn of time, whether it's like industry or recreation versus commercial.  But I do feel like policy can help us, and I think that's the only way to make real change.


        And I also don't think that targeting day-to-day consumers and small industry, or small individual-owned businesses like the lobster industry, is going to do anything to make a change.  Just putting all of the change on individuals is not where we need to go.  So I do see hope, hopefully, that if we make more global change, that things will be a little bit better.  It's like we know the top 10 – like we know where our plastics are mainly coming from.  So I always am like, it's not an individual's fault, and don't take that on.  So I feel like the only way to have real change is to really have policy affect the big players out there.


        And I guess in a more positive light, I feel like we can get there with companies like what Viable Gear is doing.  We're doing this for a purpose, and it is to make our oceans more healthy.  And it is to hopefully reduce plastics in our oceans globally and in our soils globally and all of that.  So yeah, there's hope.


Q:        [59:37] Have you noticed any change or just have you had any observations about women's status, participation, or presence in the marine industry in your time working with Viable Gear?


A:        [59:49] Yeah, I feel like – I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like I tend to find women in the industry.  So I don't know if that's like a me thing or a them thing being so willing to talk to me or stay connected.  But I don't know, women are just better.  Sorry.  (laughter) I don't know.  It's just like a bunch of badass women doing really cool things out there.  And I think that's why there's support in this space or why I feel like there's more women doing this that I know, anyway.


        I feel like women tend to take things like this onto their moral plate, too.  That could be wrong.  I'm not like a gender studies expert at all.  I don't know.  I just feel like there's women who are taking on these issues and being like, OK, what can we do, and how do we do this?  There's always been badass women on the water, and Maine's just full of badass Maine women anyway.  So coming back here, I was like, yeah, I like Maine women a lot.  They're great.


Q:        [1:00:59] Thank you.  Is there anything else you wanted to mention before we sort of bring things to a close?


A:        [1:01:05] I don't think so.  I mean, thank you guys for doing this.  Yeah, it's a fun place to be and a scary place to be and an exciting place to be.  And I think doing this work is really important.  So the more people who support it and know that we're coming at it from a positive lens and not wanting to step on any toes in any industry – it's like really just creating solutions.


        And working directly with people – I feel like that's a big thing that I forgot to mention, which is like we'll talk to anybody.  If anybody is like, we'll test this for you or has questions – like if people are totally against what we're doing, I'm really curious why.  And I always want to talk to those people almost even more, because it's like, really?  Why?  What does this do to you that you're threatened by that we're working on a plastic replacement?  But yeah, it's just like a fun space to be in right now, and we'll talk to anybody.  So yeah.


Q:        [1:02:01] Great, thank you.  Do you have any questions before we call things?


Q:        [1:02:06] I don't think so.


Q:        [1:02:07] Great.  Well, thank you so much.  I'll go ahead and stop this.


END OF FILE"
"25","Q: [00:00:03] How do you like to introduce yourself


A: [00:00:05] As Joanie.


Q: [00:00:07] Joanie. And what year were you born? 


A: [00:00:09]1959. 


Q: [00:00:11] Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?


A: [00:00:14] Well, I grew up in the city of Brockton, Massachusetts, and it was a pretty good neighborhood most of the time. Well, we moved around a lot. Some of the neighborhoods were good. (laughter) Went to a lot of different elementary schools down there. Anyways, a friend of mine said that's why I'm so tough, because I come from Brockton. (laughter) I told her I was a rough, tough cream puff. (laughter)


Q: [00:00:40] And where are your parents from?


A: [00:00:42] Oh, they're from also Brockton, and one was Bridgewater, Massachusetts. You don't hear of that one much.


Q: [00:00:47] What did they do?


A: [00:00:48] Let's see. My dad did all kinds of different jobs. He usually worked for himself when he could – construction. He even had a clam business, believe it or not, at the end before he died. My mom – well, they were split up, so she was a stay-at-home mom for most of the time and did odd jobs here and there when she could. Yeah. Want me to shut my phone off?


F: [00:01:19] It’s OK. No, don’t worry about it.


Q: [00:01:21] How did your dad get into clamming? Was he from a fishing family? 


A: [00:01:26] Well, he moved up here to Maine, and he married into a family that was clam diggers. Actually, I had the clamming business first (laughter) before I started clam-digging myself. When I had the business, I had enough of it because it was taking away too much from my family life because it's seven days a week when you have your own clam business, and that was just too much for me. I was like, “No, I don't like this schedule.” So, after a couple of years, I sold it to my dad. He took it over, and that's how he got into the clamming business.


Q: [00:02:01] Oh, that's awesome. I haven't heard that before. (laughter) Do you have any siblings?


A: [00:02:06] I do. A brother and a sister and a half-sister in New Mexico and a step-sister in Waldoboro.


Q: [00:2:15] Is anyone else in your family involved in the fishing industry at all?


A: [00:02:21] My stepsister. She cuts clams over in Waldoboro for Abden Simmons and April Simmons. I don't know if you know them or not. Yeah.


Q: [00:2:32] Other than that, no fish processing or marketing?


A: [00:02:35] No.


Q: [00:02:37] Can you describe your educational background?


A: [00:02:40] I finished high school – well, night school because I had a child when I was seventeen. I did finish the year I was supposed to. So that was neat. Just brought her with me to night school. (laughter)


Q: [00:02:55] Are you married?


A: [00:02:56] I am. The second time. (laughter)


Q: [00:03:00] Is your partner in the fishing industry at all?


A: [00:03:03] My husband. That's how we met.


Q: [00:03:05] Clamming?


A: [00:03:06] Actually, clamming. Yes. I got thrown into his boat. Well, not thrown. But I got put on his boat because we were digging depuration at the time. And that's how we met. We were friends for three years before we did get together. (laughter)


Q: [00:03:20] Do you have any children?


A: [00:03:21] I have two girls.


Q: [00:03:23] And are they involved in the fishing industry at all? 


A: [00:03:26] One was for a short time because she married a clam digger at the time, but she didn't stick with it. Now, she works for UPS. (laughter) A little more stable.


Q: [00:3:39] How would you describe your role in the fishing industry in Maine?


A: [00:03:44] My role? Such as –?


Q: [00:03:48] Your job.


A: [00:03:52] I dig clams. I go with my husband sometimes, but he's taught me how to go alone so that when he can't – recently, he's had a bad knee, so I've been going alone. I'll go to Vinalhaven by myself or down the river by myself. It’s a very free feeling when you get to do it by yourself. I like being the captain. (laughter)


Q: [00:04:14] I bet. Have you been involved in any other forms of fishing? 


A: [00:04:18] Earlier on, I did try diving for urchins and scallops and things like that. But being a woman, back then, it was hard to get the outfits to fit you properly, so I was always freezing to death. As soon as I made back my money that I paid for all my gear, I quit. That was enough of it.


Q: [00:04:35] Wow. What was that like? The urchin fishing?


A: [00:04:39] It's very difficult because I'm always on a boat with men, and being a woman in the business, it was like – when you have to go the bathroom, things like that – the men were always very respectful of me. I must say, they always were. I appreciated that very much. But when you had to go the bathroom, it was just difficult. When you had your period, you just didn't go. (laughter)


Q: [00:05:04] How did you get involved in that? 


A: [00:05:07] Just talking with people through – when I was buying the clams, I'd meet different guys, and they'd tell me about it and say, “Oh, you got to try it.” So, I did and got out of it, like I said. That's actually how it became a clam digger, but you'll probably get to that question.


Q: [00:05:20] Oh, tell me more. 


A: [00:05:22] (laughter) Oh, it started off – I actually have it written right here. It’s probably better if I read it. I won't forget something. Because they did ask me how I got into that. Let's see. Well, I'll just tell you. So I had a clam digger. A lot of them used to just love to sit and gab. It's kind of like a guy in a mechanic shop; everybody gathers together there. A lot of them would just sit and gab with me. And one older man said – I said, “I think I need to go to the gym and start working out.” He's like, “Well, why would you go to the gym and work out? Pay to go to the gym when you can go to work and get paid?” I'm like, “Doing what?” And he's like, “Go clamming.” And I was like, “Well, you show me how, and I'll try it out.” He showed me how, and I was very bad at it at first, of course, but as you keep at it, you get better. I just loved it. I loved being out there doing it, and I could go the day I wanted to go, not go the days I didn't want to go. That worked out much better. And from there on, I was hooked, no pun intended. (laughter) That was over thirty years ago. 


Q: [00:06:24] That’s a great story. Which commercial fishing licenses do you hold?


A: [00:06:28] I hold a clamming fishing license and just a commercial fishing license, which you needed for periwinkles. Back when we had a red tide scare, we were doing a lot of periwinkling.


Q: [00:06:41] Do you have any experience in the industry beyond directly harvesting itself, as in bookkeeping, post-harvest, research, or food preparation?


A: [00:06:53] No, not that I can remember. I'm on some committees to do with clamming. 


Q: [00:07:02] Which committees?


A: [00:07:03] I'm on the town – we have five towns involved in our clamming association, so I'm on that committee, and then I'm on the SHaC committee with the state. That's about it for now. I keep the books for it. You have to do so many hours to keep your clam license here. So, I keep the books on the hours, on what people do to get the hours. Conservation time, we call it.


Q: [00:07:29] That was my next question, if the committees are requirements, or if that's a motivation that you have to be on –?


A: [00:07:38] The committee isn't a requirement, although it's a requirement from the state, I believe, to have a committee. You're not required, if you're a digger, to be on the committee. Is that the question? 


Q: [00:07:49] Yes.


A: [00:07:50] But I chose to be on that committee. I used to go to the committee meetings and not even be a part of the committee because I thought I should have a voice in what's going on in my job, which I wish more people would do. You can't get people to go to them. I don't know what they're doing, but they’re not interested in keeping things going, I guess. I'm very interested in keeping things going for our future children that want to do this. So, that's my motivation there.


Q: [00:08:15 ] That's great. What does an average day of work look like for you? 


A: [00:08:19] Well, that has changed completely from about ten years ago. We used to put in three or four days, do our job, go sell our clams, and we had the rest of the day to ourselves. Well, now you're putting in seven to eight hours, at least, a day, and sometimes even longer after you sold your clams because there’s been such a change in the mud. So, that's why.


Q: [00:08:44] I'll get into what those changes will be in a little. How do you feel your background or identity shapes your work in the fishing sector, including how others may perceive you?


A: [00:08:56] Let's see. Well, my background was stay-at-home mom. (laughter) I don't know how that shapes me. It shaped me? I come from a hard-working family that always believed in hard work. You don't just get handed – my father had a construction company. If I wanted school clothes, I worked doing that – construction company – to get my school clothes. Nothing was just handed to you. You were taught that work was a part of it all. I brought my children and grandchildren up the same way. A lot of my grandchildren have gone clamming with me. They didn't stick with it but got them through high school. (laughter)


Q: [00:09:36] How does your role in the fishing sector work with any family or caregiving responsibilities?


A: [00:09:42] Well, it works very well as far as I could take the time off. If my daughter called and said, “I need somebody to watch such-and-such a child” – my grandchildren, I could just say, “OK, I won't go digging today.” I had my mom go through a grieving process when her husband had passed away, and I got to just say, “You know what? I'm taking the week off from work.” No flack. I could do that. That was very important to me, be able to be there for your family when you need to be. Not everybody can do that, unfortunately.


Q: [00:10:12] So, you feel like maybe your job as a clammer lended itself to more flexibility. 


A: [00:10:18] Oh, much more. 


Q: [00:10:21] I'm going to switch to asking more environmental questions. Can you describe any changes in the marine environment you've noticed?


A: [00:10:36] Say that again.


Q: [00:10:36] Can you describe any changes in the marine environment you've noticed?


A: [00:10:40] There's been big ones. As far as what I told you, from my workday being so much longer, it's because all the clams seem to have moved inside. About two years, all the clams just disappeared. I'm not kidding. They just disappeared. We were getting 200 pounds each, my husband and I, and we went down in that two years to nothing. I would walk a whole cove and didn't find a hole to pick a clam. I'm a picker, by the way. I don't know. Do you know the difference between picker and hoe digger? Well, a picker, you just put your hand in the mud, and you walk along, and you pluck the clam out, and you put it in your hod. I know we all have different names for things up and down the coast. (laughter) I don't know what they call a hod Downeast. I think it's different. And they don't call it picking; they call it plucking, I believe. (laughter) It's quite interesting. We're in the same state, and we have different names for things. But that’s OK.


F: [00:11:32] So, that’s instead of raking?


A: [00:11:33] Instead of raking. But then, when the clamming had changed, the whole environment changed. The flats that used to be soft were now hard for some reason. They had big dips in them. This is in a matter of two years. It was just really strange. I don't know what caused it. They had big dips, like holes. It looked like Mars. Am I in the same place? It was a really odd feeling. I just don't even know how to explain it. It was just different. And like I said, the mud was harder, so I had to learn to hoe dig. I already did a little bit of dabbling in it, so I had to learn to hoe dig, and that was much harder, and the income wasn't as good because picking is easier, and you can get more clams usually. 


Q: [00:12:17] So, you had to go from being able to manually dig to having to use a tool to go deeper?


A: [00:12:23] Yes. Not so much go deeper, just to be able to turn the mud over because you have to be able to get your hand in there. We have soft mud here. Not everywhere has that.


Q: [00:12:36] Do you guys have an idea of why the mud may have changed? 


A: [00:12:40] Well, it was kind of a perfect storm going on. It was about 2014,’15, ’16, in there, and we had big fights going on with worm diggers. At the time, worm diggers were coming from everywhere. They were just digging and digging over in our river, and Waldoboro and, I think, down in Brunswick, too. It was just big clash fights between us all. They usually dig once or twice for their worms, which was fine because it used to help us out, actually, by turning the mud and keeping it soft. But for some reason, they were coming back four or five times and digging that same mud, and it was just making it so soupy, and they were taking so many worms. I really believe that they took too many worms. They took all these worms because they were just going over and over it, and then the mud wasn't right. It was turning black. You need worms in a garden. You need worms in that kind of garden too, I believe, a clam garden, we'll call it. Then, like I said, the clams disappeared. We had green crabs coming in. Also, that soft, soft mud, I think that helped the blood – not blood worms. I call them tapeworms. What's a better word for the tapeworm, those great, big, long worms?  Ribbon worms. Ribbon worms. We were infiltrated with them, which we never had before. You might have saw one here and there once in a great while, but they were just, all of a sudden, there, and they like big clams. So, you see a clam hole, you go to get it, and they pull out, and it's just an empty shell. There wasn't a clam there because the worm had already gotten to it. So, between all of that, I think that was the devastation. I think turning that mud over so much could have brought up old things that might have been buried in the mud. I don't know. Because it's almost like a virus went through. Even the mussels disappeared. We have no mussel beds no more. We had many mussel beds down the river. They're gone.


Q: [00:14:40] Were you able to change your location at all, or did you feel that –?


A: [00:14:44] I did try going to Vinalhaven, but they didn't have many clams either. They did come back in Vinalhaven pretty good, and then they opened up some new area. So, this past year and a half, they opened up the bay for the first time in St. George River, and there's been many clams in there. Some reason, it seems to circulate in there, and they seem to land in there. It works out pretty well. If it wasn't for that, I don't know if I'd be able to be doing clamming. I might have had to find another job.


Q: [00:15:18] What was the reason the bay was closed?


A: [00:15:21] Pollution, they say. Depuration used to dig it, though. But the guy that heads up our committee was just very adamant about taking tests of water and this and that and proving that it could be opened. He did it with a lot of our help, of course. That was a good deal. (laughter)


Q: [00:15:42] That’s great.


A: [00:15:43] So, we're back to getting our two hundred pounds when we can dig there, which we also conserve. We're big on conservation in our committee, and so we conserve it by only being able to dig it three days a week, June, July, and August.


Q: [00:15:57] You described a lot of changes in the environment. How do they impact your work? You kind of already talked about this, but if there's anything else.


A: [00:16:06] It just impacted it by a longer day. Price of clams did go up for a little bit, but now it's back down again. I know the economy probably runs that. I don't know how that part of it all – I never dealt with that part of it. So, it hurts your pay of what you're getting. So, if you have any big bills you don't want – that’s why we built our house little by little as we saved and did it because clamming is so up and down with how much money you're going to make every year; you never know how much you're going to make. That's why we say we'll save and build, save and build, and that's what we did.


Q: [00:16:45] Have you done any other things to respond to or be able to adapt to these changes, such as the gear you use or pursuing other livelihood opportunities?


A: [00:17:00] As far as pursuing something else, I haven't – well, I'm going to have a piece of real estate that I'll be renting out, so I have pursued something else for different income. But at my age, there's nothing more I really wanted to pursue and still have time for my family.


Q: [00:17:19] Are there any resources, relationships, knowledge, training, or organizations that you're able to draw upon to make those changes and adaptations?


A: [00:17:32] In the ShAC [Shellfish Advisory Council] – trying to think what that even stands for. (laughter) In the ShAC, to do with this state, we meet in the state building, and sometimes we go up – Ellsworth, I believe we meet. About every three months, we meet up together. It's different people. We have clam diggers, we have clam dealers, and we have the state people also, and they're very good at bringing the conversation up to what we might be able to do, what might work, what has worked, what hasn't worked. We all have that kind of discussion going on. It's been very helpful. We have one being pushed right now, a law trying to be pushed in the legislature about being able to sell our clams out of our truck, which we can't do right now. We can sell from my home, which is very helpful because when the price – this spring, it went under two dollars a pound. Can you imagine this day and age, only getting two dollars a pound for your clams? That's crazy. So, it was very helpful for me to just put on Facebook that I'm selling clams from my home and get at least three dollars. I don't know if I answered that all. (laughter)


Q: [00:18:41] That's great. Can you tell me more about the different species that you've been seeing, maybe the changes in the mud flats? You mentioned green crabs. 


A: [00:18:54] Yeah. Lots more green crabs I've been seeing. They've always been around, but I think they're getting just overpopulated, maybe. I want to say the tapeworm. What did I call it? What’s that other worm I was talking about?


F: [00:19:13] Ribbon worm.


A: [00:19:14] The ribbon worm, thank you. (laughter) Plenty of ribbon worms. They can grow three, four feet long. They're gross. (laughter) That's about the only difference. Actually, I was talking to somebody the other day. He was fishing on the St. George upper river, and he said he found a blue crab. 


Q: [00:19:35] Wow. How long have you been noticing the green crabs in the flats?


A: [00:19:42] Probably close to ten years. I've seen them before that, but more so. I was actually kayaking to go clamming one day. I knew it was going to be late when I got back, and it's a hard spot. It was down in the (gig?). That's part of our system, our five-town system. Not sure what the town – it’s South Thomaston, maybe. I was kayaking down to go climbing somewhere, and on my way back, it was dark because it's hard to get your boat on the landing if it's too early before it's higher tide. I was kayaking back, and I heard this terrible noise, like, crunch, crunch, crunch. I was like, “What the heck is that?” So I look over with my flashlight on the flats, and it was thousands of green crabs just crunching along the mud. (laughter) It was like, “Oh my gosh, it’s like a horror movie.”


Q: [00:20:33] Wow. And you hadn't seen that before?


A: [00:20:38] No, I hadn't noticed it.


Q: [00:20:41] What's your access to the flats like? 


A: [00:20:45] Well, I mainly go by boat, and when I first started digging, I used to walk in, and it was tough duty. You'd have to find someplace to be able to walk in for access to the water, and then lugging them out was always a chore. When you got 150 pounds of clams to lug out for a quarter of a mile or a half mile, it's not easy. It's sometimes right uphill. But access has become a problem. We haven't had too much of a problem up until recently. I can see why, too. There's always that bad apple that ruins it for everybody. There was one guy who drove his truck down on this guy's property, got stuck, and just ruined the guy's property to get out. Didn't offer to fix it for him or anything. I can see it. He said, “One more incident, I'm closing.” I couldn't believe he didn't close it, but he said, “One more incident, I'm closing down.” We do have a place over in Barney's Cove on the St. George that we've lost access to, and another place down in Salt Pond that we've lost access to just because of people mouthing off to the owners and leaving trash, going to the bathroom. Yeah, there's a lot of nastiness. (laughter) People just disrespect people. Then again, you got to look at it on the other side. A lot of clam diggers – we have a lot of clam diggers that aren't capable of working out in regular jobs around people, and they just can't hold that kind of job. Mental illness is there, but they can dig clams. So, unfortunately, that's what you have a lot of, too.


F: [00:22:29] Can I go back to the green crabs? You talked about seeing a real increase in them. How does the increase in green crabs – you notice that impacting clam populations or where you see them?


A: [00:22:40] I think so. We used to be able to dig – the reason we only had to dig three or four hours is because clams are way outside. You didn't have to go all the way into shore and wait for that tide to come back in to get your boat out. There's no clams on the outside anymore, anywhere, even on Vinalhaven, outside, and I think the green crabs are eating them.


F: [00:23:00] So, outside being subtidal, underwater all the time?


A: [00:23:03] Yeah.


F: [00:23:05] So, now you have to go into the intertidal, and you’re dependent on those tides.


A: [00:23:08] Yes. They keep saying, “Well, maybe it's the warmer waters.” Well, I'm thinking, “Well, it's probably warmer inside than it is outside, so I don't know if that would be a factor.”


F: [00:23:16] Yeah. Do you hear discussions about it on the committees that you're on about conservation measures about the impacts of crabs on the population?


A: [00:23:26] Yeah. They've kind of given up on it because nothing seems to – well, there is help out there, like people that go out there and trap them – will try to get rid of them, will trap them. My husband brought some in one time, and we had them in a five-gallon bucket. I don't know if everybody wants to know this (laughter), but he left him out there for like a week, and it was like ninety-degree weather. And them things were still alive. They’re hardy.


F: [00:23:47] They’re tough.


A: [00:23:48] You got to stomp them. (laughter)


F: [00:23:50] Yeah. And then one more question. This question about changes – in terms of changes in the mud, you talked about the impact of maybe wormers having an impact on that. Do you think anything about changing temperatures or changes in sea ice, or anything are impacting the kind of consistency of the mud, or you think it's not related to that? 


A: [00:24:13] Well, ice did used to have a factor. It doesn't seem to be – the past winters haven't been cold enough to have much ice. But ice used to – I mean, they’d carry big rocks and place them in different places because you have to be careful when you're – we used to go screaming in with our boat, but you have to be careful when it comes spring because you don't know what might have been laid there from an iceberg, from a rock or something. I think, as far as to do with the clams, I don't know how it would affect the clams. Some people think that if too much ice is on the flats, it hurts the clams. But I don’t think so.


Q: [00:24:48] I guess I was wondering about the – you were talking about the changes to the mud, if that could be related to the lack of sea of ice or changes in –?


A: [00:24:55] Well, the big dips I was talking about, we were wondering – talking with other diggers, we're wondering if maybe – because all of a sudden, the sturgeon have started coming up our river. I guess they eat clams also, so I've heard, and you can see where they stick their nose in looking for the clam. Actually, when I go clamming, I look to see where they've stuck their nose in, so I can find the clams. (laughter) Because if they’re searching for them – and they have that smell evidently, or something. They think that they get in there, wallow around, or wish their tails around something. They're pretty powerful. When I'm going up the river, sometimes I'll see them just jump up in the air.


F: [00:25:34] Thank you. 


A: [00:25:35] You’re welcome.


Q: [00:25:36] What would you say your biggest concern for the marine environment is?


A: [00:25:41] Biggest concern. Well, is for them not to replenish themselves, the clams and stuff. But then, like I said, we open the bay, and I go up in there, and I see them replenishing themselves beautifully up in there. There's all kinds, all different sizes, from itty-bitty baby clams to nice, big clams. So, not sure.


Q: [00:26:09] If you could tell policymakers in Maine what the biggest priorities should be to help people adapt to the changes, what would you tell them? 


A: [00:26:17] Well, they probably wouldn't like to hear it. Keep dogs off our shores. Dog waste is a number one thing we keep – we do a lot of testing on our own, without the state, because we want to know what is impacting. We do deeper. They only test for different – like, bacterial, things like that. But we test a little deeper to find out what is causing the resource that's making our river stay closed on different coves. And we have a lot of dog waste. The problem with dog waste is what they eat. We have nothing against dogs. We love animals, but the dog waste – what they eat is different things – it's not like what a horse would eat or a cow would eat. There's too many chemicals and things in what the dogs are eating, and it's really affecting the water quality. I know Waldorboro won a battle about having dogs on the landing, and we're still fighting it over here. We have a lot of dog owners. Especially in the bay, where we finally got that open, and they had a walkway – there was a little stream that would actually come into the bay, and they could walk their dogs there and stuff. Well, we actually won that battle with them, not being able to walk their dogs on that, but now there's a new person, a head of it, and he's changed it so that dogs are allowed again. So far, they've been picking up the dog waste. We check it ourselves because it's our livelihood.


Q: [00:27:42] That's interesting. Can you tell me a little bit more about that testing that you guys do, that process, what that's like?


A: [00:27:50] We just go down, and we'll test different streams, and we'll test the water with a little test tube. The state, I think, showed us how to do it. Well, the guy that runs our committee. He showed us. But the state showed him how to do it properly. We take a test tube, and we send it off to the place in New Hampshire, and they do testing to tell us if it's human or birds or dogs or that kind of stuff. 


Q: [00:28:14] Interesting.


A: [00:28:15] Yeah, it's not cheap. We get grants to help do that. 


Q: [00:28:25] That’s great. Can you tell me a little bit about your experience or the history of the closures? Has that been more prevalent, or have you noticed any changes with that?


A: [00:28:36] Actually, I have noticed more openings than closures. They're working better with us now. (laughter) Everybody's working together better, I should say, and I think it's helping with the closures. Sometimes, they'll let us do the testing for them if they can't because they're understaffed, the state, which is a great help, or we'll have a boat available for them because they can't get out all the time in a boat. So, we'll have a boat available for them, and they'll take care of it that way. What else was we talking about? (laughter)


Q: [00:29:11] No, that’s great. I can tell you're a really active participant in your community. Can you tell me if you participated in any climate resilience or adaptation training or programs in the fishing industry?


A: [00:29:24] No, no. Just on word of mouth through different people, the ShAC. They're very informative on the ShAC. They have a lot of different people in there – biologists and things like that.


F: [00:29:37] What's the ShAC? It stands for something, is that what you said?


A: [00:29:41] Yeah, I know. That’s what I trying to think – it’s to do with the state. I should look it up.


F: [00:29:46] Something to do with the state? DMR [Department of Marine Resources]?


A: [00:29:48] Yeah.


F: [00:29:48] OK, we can look it up. Thanks. But it provides information?


A: [00:29:52] Yes. Shellfish –


F: [00:29:55] Advisory Committee.


A: [00:29:57] Advisory Committee. There you go. Yeah. (laughter)


F: [00:29:58] There we go. Great.


Q: [00:30:03] What strategies do you think would be effective in building resilience against climate-related impacts for fisheries?


A: [00:30:12] I'm really not sure. I really don't know what we could use to – I'd like to know.


Q: [00:30:25] Are there other types of changes, not only environmental, that are impacting your work you want to tell us about?


A: [00:30:34] My age. (laughter)


F: [00:30:37] It's tough work on your – you've been doing it a long time. You must have to –


A: [00:30:41] I have. About thirty-five years. People say, “Oh my gosh, how's your back?” I'm like, “Well, actually, it strengthens my back if I'm doing it all the time.” After the winter – I used to go all winter, too, but not anymore. So, come spring, I know I haven't gone all winter, believe me. (laughter) I make sure I do stretches and exercises every day to keep myself up to par for it.


Q: [00:31:02] Yeah. What does your season look like? 

A: [00:31:06] Nowadays, usually, I start in about April, March if it’s a warm March. My protocol used to be, “Well, it's above twenty degrees, I'll go.” Then, when I got a little older, “If it's above thirty degrees, I'll go.” Now, I kind of like it forty. (laughter)


F: [00:31:28] Still pretty cold.


A: [00:31:29] Yeah, it is. It depends on the wind. The wind is a big factor out there, of course. It’s nice to have a boat. I don't think I finished that other thing where I was talking to you about walking in. I prefer going by boat all the time. 


Q: [00:31:43] Yeah, tell me a little bit about how your operation works. What does it look like to go out on the flats with you?


A: [00:31:51] Well, you just hook up my boat. Decide where I'm going to go beforehand, hopefully. Sometimes, I get there, and there's already too many people there, so I'll look for a different spot. I like being a loner out there a little bit. I'll hook up my boat, head out there, unload my boat down on the landing, head upriver, and just looking for a spot to dig. Usually, you have it, like I said, pre-planned. You have to get up there early, otherwise, you can't get your boat in there because the tide will leave. I end up bringing my kayak sometimes, and I'll leave the boat out, and I'll kayak in with all my gear being towed behind me in a sled, and that's how I'll get back out to my boat also. I was a little worried one day because I had my sled, had about 150 pounds in there, and it's about what it holds. It started getting a little choppy, and there was some boats going by, creating a wave. And I was like, “Hmm, that's attached to my kayak. If that sinks, I'm going with it.” (laughter) So, I got a little smarter on that one. Not put so many in there. 


F: [00:33:03] You said you start in April. When do you go until?


A: [00:33:05] Up until, usually October. November if some good days or something. I might go hoe digging even in December and January if there's some good days. I've just been building that house down there. So, that's kept me busy a couple years.


Q: [00:33:20] Is the amount of clams you bring in consistent throughout the year, or does it change seasonally?


F: [00:33:27] It changes because I start hoe digging, usually when it gets colder. I've already started hoe digging only because I can't find no clams to pick on the river. They close up after it gets kind of cold, the holes, so it's hard to find them. So, I'll start the hoe digging now. So, of course, that's less clams I'll have. I don't know. Like I said, I was getting 200 pounds in the bay picking, but now I'm hoe digging, I think I had a bushel last time I went – fifty pounds.


F: [00:33:59] Can I ask what –? So it sounds like you prefer picking, but you do a little bit of picking and hoe digging. Is that typical for people to do both? How do people get more into one or the other? 


A: [00:34:12 ] I think it's how they were brought up. A lot of the guys around here, they were brought up doing this for a living. If their father was a digger, than they dig. If their father was a picker, they pick.


F: [00:34:23] I feel like you hear more about digging in general, I would say.


A: [00:34:28] Yeah, probably.


F: [00:34:29] So, there’s less pickers (inaudible).


A: [00:34:30] Well, on this river, there was a lot of pickers. It used to be (laughter) when you could dig – when there was more clams and the clams were outside, there was a lot of pickers. A lot of the men picked because it was just easier on your back, too. I see a lot of them hoe diggers, and they hunched over pretty good, them older ones. I don’t want to look like that. (laughter)


F: [00:34:53] You’ve got good posture. 


A: [00:34:54] Well, my mother made sure of it. (laughter)


Q: [00:34:59] Well, it sounds like a really labor-intensive job. What is it about clamming that draws you in?


A: [00:35:05] Being outside. I was always an outside kid. I love being outside. I was one of the kids that if you were in school, you're looking out the window, wishing you were out there. That's all there was to it. Being self-employed, I love that part of it. Running a boat – it's just a lot of fun stuff.


Q: [00:35:27] Do you hope to involve your grandchildren?


A: [00:35:30] I already have. My oldest grandchild is thirty now. We've had a few of them come and clam. They were interested until the clamming got bad, of course, and then it's not much fun. I mean, we've even – one day, there was a kid down at the wharf, and he was riding his bike around. I said, “What are you doing riding around? Why aren't you down there making some money? You're old enough.” And he was like, “I don't know how.” And I said, “Well, let me contact your mother, and you meet me down here tomorrow morning.” And he did. He was on our boat for most of the summer, and he learned how. We've had a couple others. Actually, they're in the Merchant Marines now that we've brought clamming with us and taught how to –


Q: [00:36:06] That’s awesome. Do you mainly work on your own, or do you have people that help you?


A: [00:36:14] Usually, my husband and I together, but when he's not going, it's just myself. Yeah.


Q: [00:36:21] Can you tell me about any opportunities or positive changes you've experienced in the industry?


A: [00:36:26] The positive change would be being able to sell from our home, first of all, and now what they're trying to do and pass us being able to sell from our truck so that we could actually go to farmers markets. I have some people that don't want to travel that far to get to my house. I can meet them halfway, or something to buy clams. Of course, the dealers aren’t liking this idea, I'm sure, of us being able to sell our clams on our own because that's going to affect how much they have to pay us to get us to go there, which is rightly due. I know how the farmers feel. They do all the work, and they don't get much money for their product.


Q: [00:37:04] Can you tell me more about that? Your experience with working with dealers?


A: [00:37:10] Well, this past dealer that we've had in town – our dealer that we always dealt with for years and years gave it up – Karl Crute. He was just old enough that he just wasn't going to deal with it anymore. I don't know how many years he was there, but he was there the whole time I ever dug. He gave it up a couple years ago, and he always tried to get us the fairest prices and good prices. If we ever wanted to buy anything – he used to buy all kinds of seafood. If we ever wanted to buy anything, he would always sell them to us for what he paid for him. He was a very fair man that way. Then, all of a sudden, when he was done, it was like there wasn't enough competition. That's when the price really started slacking unless the guy really wanted them bad. Then he’d put that price up all of a sudden, and then, he didn't need him, he'd drop it right down. He didn't let you know what the price was. Karl Crute, when he was buying, he'd let you know what the price was in the beginning before you went clamming, so you knew what you're going to get. Well, the newer guy, they let you know in the middle of the tide when you're digging. They'll just drop that price on you. Once in a while, it goes up, not very often. Usually, it was dropped. I didn't think that was very fair at all. I didn't like that kind of dealing. 


Q: [00:38:29] How does that impact your harvesting process? 


A: [00:38:33] Well, it kind of takes away your zeal to want to dig them hard that day when you get a message like that in the middle of the tide. That just pops your balloon. But you know you got to make a living, so you got to do it. 


Q: [00:38:47] Right. What is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's coastal fisheries?


A: [00:38:52] To see more children get involved – older children, high school kids. I just don't see many anymore. I don't see many getting into – we offer free clam licenses for first-time clammer kids. We can't get them. We just can't get them. They're not interested. I don't know what they'd rather be doing, but it's not clamming, evidently. (laughter) I have a great-grandchild that's very interested, but he's only seven right now. (laughter) I can tell he just loves being that outdoor-type stuff. I could see it in him. He'll probably be a clam digger if there are any clams around still, then.


Q: [00:39:31] Do you have an idea of how that could change, getting people more involved or wanting to?


A: [00:39:37] Well, we've already tried. We've gone to high schools. We’ll put out bulletins seeing if anybody would be interested. I think it would be better if we opted to – “Hey, we'll take you.” I mean, they don't know how to get there, some of them.” But then you have the problem of, well, what if that kid says I looked at them wrong or touched them wrong? I mean, there's just so many differences going on these days that you have to worry about now that you never had to worry about before.


Q: [00:40:10] Have you noticed any changes in women's presence or participation in the fishery?


A: [00:40:17] Changes as far as more? We've had more. A lot of women in the past thirty years that I've been involved. A lot of women come and go, and some of them stick with it. Some don't. Some are usually there with their boyfriends that they had for the season. (laughter) I know a couple that have stuck right through it, but then couldn't afford or needed health insurance. That's another problem is the health insurance for self-employed people. I went for years without any health insurance. I just did the best to stay healthy. 


Q: [00:40:51] That's hard to have control over. 


A: [00:40:53] Now that I'm sixty-five, it's pretty good. I get free insurance. (laughter)


Q: [00:40:58] Congrats. 


F: [00:41:00] You said you've seen women throughout your time, but maybe some more over time. Is that right?


A: [00:41:06] Yeah, yeah. As the years went on, I saw more women getting involved. 


F: [00:41:10] Have you ever seen changes in terms of reception, how they're treated, or something relative to male diggers?


A: [00:41:22] No, no. I haven't seen the difference in that. I think we all get treated pretty equally in this. Most of the diggers respect me as a woman, being out there. Like when they have to urinate, they'll turn their back, thankfully, or go up in the woods. That's another difficult thing for us women is when we have to go to the bathroom. When you have a boat, it's pretty good. You can climb in your boat. But when you don't, you have to either walk all the way up to shore and go find a place. Yeah, it's difficult sometimes being a woman out there that way. Men get it pretty easy that way. (laughter)


Q: [00:42:05] I think that's it for our questions. But is there anything else you'd like to share with us?


A: [00:42:11] Let me look over on my notes.


Q: [00:42:13] Yes, please do. We love stories.


A: [00:43:15] One time, I was clamming on my own. I walked in because it was wintertime. I was walking in; it was all ice. I had my hods and my gear, and as I was getting done – I pushed it a little longer than I wanted to, but I pushed it because I said, “I'll get up on that ice; I'll be all set.” Well, I got up on that ice, and it gave way. And the tide was coming pretty good. The whole side of me went in. Thankfully, I could grab up onto the ice, got myself back up, and crawled instead of walking with my gear. That hod actually helps you on the ice, to walk along with it. I had a fork, too, so I could claw if I needed to. I did make it, obviously. Here I am. But that was kind of scary. Sometimes, when I walk in alone at different places, or even if I'm in my boat, it gets kind of scary if there's some strange people around coming to dig that I don't know. Especially when we had a lot of the worm diggers because I felt kind of – because they were drinking a lot down there and stuff, too. Actually, I was picking, and I said to one of the worm diggers that was right there – I said, “What do you do with your bottles when you're done drinking?” And he says, “Oh, we just crush them up real good.” I said, “In the mud? Do you see how I'm digging? I'm putting my hand in this mud.” (laughter) Sometimes, I just felt a little intimidated. There's a whole bunch of men out there, and it's just me, the woman here. Gets kind of scary.


F: [00:43:47] You mentioned it was 2014, 2015, 2016, those fights with the wormers. Has that settled down a little bit?


A: [00:43:55] Yes, it did because they stopped coming. We literally had meeting places in Augusta and everything. There were such bad fights going on. We had cops involved. People were slashing tires.


F: [00:44:07] What helped it resolve?


A: [00:44:10] It just dissipated all by itself. They stopped coming, like I said, because they got all the – we were up there one time, and one of the guys says, “Listen, we just dig them until they’re gone.” I was like, “What kind of conservation is that?”  You dig them until they're gone? That can't be healthy for the mud. But they wouldn't listen. DMR wouldn't choose a side. It's not that they wouldn't listen. They didn't want to choose a side. 


F: [00:44:41] You said at the beginning that you own your own clam business, and then you got into digging. When you say you owned your own clam business, were you a dealer?


A: [00:44:50] Yes, I was a dealer.


F: [00:44:51] OK. What was that experience like? What got into it?


A: [00:44:53] That was pretty neat. The neighbor. I was a stay-at-home mom, like I said, but the neighbor was the dealer. He wanted to go clamming, so he asked me if I'd buy for him while he was digging. So, now the diggers came. I said, “Yeah, sure.” So, I did. Well, he ended up getting in some trouble buying small clams. I don't know. Maybe I did. I didn't know the rules and regulations and stuff then. So, maybe I bought them. I don't know. But I know he dug them plenty himself. He ended up getting fined terribly. It was a big deal. He had lots and lots of clams that he got busted for. He had to get rid of the business, and he asked me if I wanted to take it over. I said, “Yeah, that'd be cool. I can be at home.” My kids went to Christian school, so I had to drive them back and forth, so I'd be free to do that. Well, I found out there was no freedom in being a dealer (laughter) because you have to be there all hours of the day for these diggers that come in whenever they're going to come in. Like I said, it was seven days a week. If I wanted to go do anything, I had to get my brother or somebody to be at the station to buy and stuff. It was terrible. (laughter)


F: [00:46:03] What year did you get into the dealer side? About when was that? 


A: [00:46:09] Let's see. About ’90, 1990.


F: [00:46:11] 1990.


A: [00:46:12] Yeah. In ’92, I left. Sold it.


F: [00:46:13] And you said you sold it to your dad, right?


A: [00:46:14] To my dad, yeah.


F: [00:46:15] How long did he stay in it? 


A: [00:46:17] Oh, jeepers. He passed away about ten years ago, and he was just about – so, it was about twelve years ago. He was in it a long time. He did well. He had trucks to go deliver to Boston. He just really built it up. 


F: [00:46:31] And then you also said your sister cuts clam. What does that mean?


A: [00:46:35] Shucking. Shucks, yeah. Shucks them out. Yeah.


F: [00:46:40] And she still does that?


A: [00:46:41] Yeah. That’s what she does still. Yeah. 


F: [00:46:44] Interesting.


A: [00:46:46] And my stepmom did, too, her mother. 


F: [00:46:48] Oh, really? You were telling us a story, and then I had some other questions for you. But was there anything else you wanted to share? Any other stories that come to mind?


F: [00:46:59] Oh, let's see. Well, one time, I broke down in Vinalhaven. I was alone again, and I was going through the thoroughfare that goes between Vinalhaven and North Haven, and all of a sudden, the motor just died. I'm like, “OK.” I had a little flip phone back then. It wasn't that long ago, actually, but I had a flip phone. I was like, “Oh, what do I do now? I'll call my husband. What's he going to do? He's way back on the mainland.” Well, all of sudden, as I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do, I saw this great big lobster boat coming through, and boy, did he put out a week. And I'm like, “Oh my gosh.” So I get my paddle out, and I'm paddling to beat the (inaudible). All of a sudden, he notices what I'm doing. So, he figured I was broke down. Thankfully, he came over, and he towed me over to a buoy that I could tie off on because he was going to bring me in. And I said, “No, I won't have no reception” because it's hard to get reception in there on your phone. He just left me out there, and I did get a ride back, towed back over to the mainland. But that was scary. You’re stuck out there for hours waiting for your to help to come. (laughter) I've been lost in the fog before, just on the river. I didn't have no compass. I had nothing on me. That was bad. This is back when I was first learning to go out on the river. The things you learn. It was so foggy, and I couldn't find my way back. I kept coming to the same buoy over and over because they’re numbers on them. I was like, “What in the world?” I just didn't want to go the wrong way. The river is only so wide, so where are you going to go? You could head out, though. I wanted to make sure I was heading in. 


We had this little porthole. Our boat was enclosed at the time for winter. We had this little porthole. So, I'm sticking my head out and trying to see better because my window kept fogging up. At the same time, it was cold air, so my poor nose was getting so stuffed up from being up in that cold air. So, finally, I'm looking, and I see – all of a sudden, I saw all these bright lights. It was like a football stadium – bright lights. I'm a praying woman, too. So, I prayed about this thing. I see these lights. So, I was like, “Well, what do they say? Head for the light, right?” (laughter) So, I'm headed to the lights, and I get up on a piece of land, and I just climbed – I moored my boat, and I climbed up on the bank, and I'm banging on these people's doors to tell them I just can't find my way. I was more worried. I wasn't worried about going out to sea or anything. What I was worried about was everybody's worried about me. Where is she? She's out there by herself. It got dark at the same time. That's why I couldn't find my way, too. It just was so dark, along with the fog. So, I said at the door – they answered, and they're like – I must have looked like quite a sight. They're like, “Oh my gosh.” (laughter) I said, “I need help.” But that's not how I said it. My nose was so stuffed up I couldn’t even talk. “I need some help.” (laughter) They brought me right in – they were such nice people – set me right down and got me a phone so I could call my husband, and he figured out where I was, and he came, and he drove the boat home. I took the car. (laughter) But it was a scary situation.


F: [00:50:09] Yeah, being out there by yourself. 


A: [00:50:12] The fog is definitely a scary thing out there. I went to Vinalhaven one time. I forgot my GPS, and we were fogged. I had my granddaughter with me. That really scared me because I had somebody else with me that I'm responsible for. The fog was just so thick. I can remember my husband always telling me – “Just keep going east. Keep following that east.” I did have a compass on the boat. But I know there's a lot of rocks and different things that you have to watch out for. So, I just had to keep listening for boats – because you have to worry about – we've almost been hit so many times going up to Vinalhaven by other boats. You just have to put your engine down a little bit and shut it off. Just listen and see if there are any lobster boats around. So we did that all the way out. I said, “Don't worry, honey, when we get out there, it'll be all clear on the way back.” Well, it wasn't. (laughter) It always is. It did not. It was the same thing. I've been out there enough so many times that I knew the different buoy bells and things like that, so I’d just have to listen, or if I hear waves going up by the shore – no, we're getting too close to the shore. (laughter)


F: [00:51:14] It’s a long haul out there to Vinalhaven.


A: [00:51:15] Yeah. I don't think she's ever been out there again with me. (inaudible)


F: [00:51:22] Last (inaudible) for her. Wonderful. Well, anything else you wanted to share with us?


A: [00:51:32] Red tide. When we had our red tide going on, that was terrible. Right now, our river is exempt from red tide. They've proven the way the tides move, the swirling of the water, or something, it does not come up into our river. But everything was closed for red tide. My husband and I were like, “Well, we heard about a place down Stonington way that's open. Let's go down there.” Well, we took our little fourteen-foot boat all the way from here to Stonington. We went over there, and we started clamming. We were doing OK. We weren't setting the world on fire or anything. Before we left, though, I wanted to say that we asked the wardens if it was open the way we were going. They said, “Yep, you're all set that place.” While we were there, it closed. Well, back then, we didn't have the cell phones like we do now. Well, I guess they did, but we didn't. The wardens came and said, “Hey, you're digging red tide closed area.” I said, “Well, we checked in Rockland before we got here.” He says, “You guys came here from Rockland in that boat?” (laughter) Like, “Yeah, you do what you got to do to make a dollar around here.” (laughter)


F: [00:52:41] Red tide, it's not a problem here in your river anymore, so it doesn't impact you much these days.


A: [00:52:48] No.


F: [00:52:50] You did mention periwinkles. You were also harvesting periwinkles.


A: [00:52:53] During this red tide series, we’d go get periwinkles. That was always so dangerous because you have to go on rocky places. I would have our boots on, and we were pretty much crawling along places, and it was slippery, and the tide would be crashing up on you. It was terrible. But we did it. You had to do something to make a living. 


F: [00:53:11] You don’t do that anymore, though?


A: [00:53:12] I never thought of a normal job. (laughter) No, we don't do it anymore. Nobody here buys them anymore. You have to go way down to Yarmouth, I think, to sell them now.


Q: [00:53:24] Have you noticed any different changes in the weather? I'm sure you're really in tune, going out day to day.


A: [00:53:30] Yeah, the tides. I notice the water, not so much the weather. The weather has gotten worse. When we come home from Vinalhaven, it's always so rough, and it wasn't like that ten years ago, we'll say. But now it is. It's always very rough coming home, and the tides don't – they go out as far, but they don't stay out as far on the big tides, and they come right back in, it seems. They don't stay out there very long. It’ll say it's a 1.8 tide, and it barely leaves the shore. It's much different. You can tell that it is rising, definitely. You can tell the water is rising. There's no doubt about that. Some people say, “Well, that's a bunch of baloney.” No, it's not. 


F: [00:54:19] The sea level, you mean?


A: [0054:19] It's really happening. The sea level is definitely rising.


F: [00:54:21] That really impacts the work that you do in the intertidal? 


A: [00:54:25] Yeah, it does.


F: [00:54:29] You also mentioned the mussel beds disappearing.


A: [00:54:31] Yeah, they’re gone.


F: [00:54:31] We’ve heard that from others, too. Do you have any sense about why that is? 


A: [00:54:35] Sometimes I just think a whole disease went through because that's the same time that the clams disappeared. I really think it was some disease that went through and just took them out because even the bay, where there's so many clams now, that was affected, also. There wasn't clam beds there. There's still no clams on the outside of the bay either, where there used to be a nice soft mud. That's gone, but you have to go inside more. 


F: [00:55:02] Has the mud texture changed there, too, in the outside, or the clams aren’t there?


A: [00:55:09] It did in some coves, but not all. Some are still real soft. But one of them, like I was telling you when we first noticed all the caved-in mud and everything, that turned hard, and we were hoe digging it, which we used to always pick. But the clams never came back after we got done hoe digging it. The mud turned black, like I said, from all the worm digging.


F: [00:55:39] Interesting. I think that's all the questions we have for you. You’re welcome to keep sharing if anything else comes up. 


A: [00:55:48] I think that was about it. I was going to let you guys take this if you wanted to read it over, if you need more information. It was a little workday thing I had one day when I was out working.


Q: [00:56:01] That’s great. Do you want to tell us about it?


A: [00:56:02] I'll read it to you. 


Q: [00:56:04] That’s great.


A: [00:56:05] OK. This was the day I went out by myself. I said, What an awesome morning it was yesterday. The first of it started with the sun being out. Just that alone was a blessing. As I headed off to work and got to the landing, there was just a handful of trucks there. I was by myself. (Glen?) had his finger operated on yesterday. I unloaded the boat and got a prime parking spot. As I headed out, I took it slow, as I noticed a man high up on one of the sloops getting ready to take down the mast over at Lyman-Morse. I see why they chose this morning. It was like a sea of glass, just beautiful. Even though there's not many pretty colored trees on the river, there's a lot of browns and dull shades of yellow and orange mixed with the green to make its own beauty. It just feels homey, kind of like today. My first encounter heading into the cove I was going to check out was a playful seal. We exchanged greetings and I continued on in. I was headed into the sun, so I couldn't see very well, but I made it out to be a group of baby ducks cutting across my destined path. I shut off the outboard and sat silently till they passed by. They didn't seem to be bothered by me and just took their sweet old time. Huh, seems that they was in the same mood I am today. So, the tide didn't do much because it was very small, and so were the clams, unfortunately. The tide didn't – oh, sorry, that's what I read. But I plugged along, just enjoying being there, listening to the hum of engines of a couple lobster boats out there and an occasional gull. I prayed for everyone that came to mind, feeling so grateful that I had a lord that gladly takes any heavy burdens I have to offer. Well, now the tide’s coming back, what little bit is left. So I wash my clams, put them in my sled, and start heading for the boat. I ended up walking quite a distance from it, so I'm glad I brought the sled. As I'm heading, I notice the wind has picked up, not a harsh, cold wind, but a nice, cool-you-off wind. It felt good along with the sun on my face. On my walk, though, I got to thinking, “This is so awesome.” Some women are out there with such stressful jobs, and I have such a peaceful, tranquil job that gets me away from all the stress and craziness for a few hours a day. I feel like the luckiest woman around. Thank you, Lord. Now, it was time to head back to the landing, load up, and go sell the goods. Some people say this is the best part. I say, No way, I just left the best part. No amount of money can give you that kind of feeling.


Q: [00:58:49] That is beautiful. 


A: [00:58:50] Well, thanks.


F: [00:58:50] Thanks for reading that.


A: [00:58:52] I write better than I speak. (laughter)


Q: [00:58:55] Thank you so much. 


F: [00:58:56] You're very welcome, and you can have them.


END OF FILE"
"26","Q: [00:00:00] You feel good to go? We can start the recording. 


A: [00:00:01] Yeah.


Q: [00:00:04] So we like to start by asking, how do you like to introduce yourself?


A: [00:00:10] Sorry, I’m overthinking that. How do I like to introduce myself? (laughter)


Q: [00:00:14] Like name, position, job, where we are –?


A: [00:00:19] I’m Sadie Samuels. I'm a commercial lobster fisherman out of Rockport Maine, and I also own a restaurant in Belfast, Maine, and we're currently in Belfast.


Q: [00:00:28] And what's your restaurant?


A: [00:00:30] My restaurant is called Must Be Nice Lobster. And my lobster boat's name is the Must Be Nice.


Q: [00:00:35] Nice. Which one came first, the boat or the restaurant?


A: [00:00:38] The boat came first.


Q: [00:00:39] Great. Is there a story behind the choice of the name? 


A: [00:00:43] Yes. So, my little sister and I started fishing together when we branched off from fishing with my dad, and we needed to get a new boat that was bigger and we could fish more on. We debated what to name it for a month, and we ended up sitting down one day and just being like, “So, what's everyone going to say when we bring this boat down, a nice, real big fishing boat?” Not huge, but a real boat. We're just sitting there, and we're like, “Everyone's just going to be like, ‘Must be nice. Must be nice.’”  So, we just put that on.


Q: [00:01:19] It stuck.


A: [00:01:20] Yep, and I've had that – I think I've had that boat for fifteen years now, something like that, maybe more. I don't know. Time flies. (laughter)


Q: [00:01:27] Do you own the boat with your sister?


A: [00:01:30] Nope. I bought her out quite a few years ago. She ended up doing some other stuff, so I'm the one who never left. (laughter)


Q: [00:01:40] Yeah. Getting into a little more of – going way back into your family background, can you tell me when you were born, what year you were born, and a little bit about where you grew up?


A: [00:01:50] I was born in 1991 in Rockport, at the Rockport hospital. I don't know. According to my dad, I went down to the harbor before I ever went home once I left the hospital, and that's where I lobster currently. I now live in Searsmont, but still fish out of Rockport. I went to high school here in Belfast.
 
Q: [00:02:17] Where are your parents from? And what did they do?


A: [00:02:21] My dad's from Locust Valley in New York, and he ended up – I think he moved here when he was fourteen or fifteen, and he's been fishing out of Rockport for – I don't know. He'll be upset if I say too many years, but more than fifty, more than fifty years. My mom was from the Waterville area, and her family owned a farm. She ended up going off, becoming a hairdresser, coming back, meeting my dad, and then they ended up on the coast. (laughter)


Q: [00:02:56] Then you mentioned a sister. How many siblings do you have? Age, gender, what do they do?


A: [00:03:01] I've got an eclectic family. (laughter) I have a big sister who's thirteen years older than me, and she lives in the Bahamas and she's a ceramicist. Then I've got two little sisters, Maggie and Molly. My older sister is Renee, but Maggie and Molly are – Maggie's thirteen months younger than me, and then Molly is four years younger than me. Maggie works for the government in some capacity. I'm not quite smart enough or have the clearance to totally understand what she does, but she works for the Foreign Service. She's the smart one in the family, we joke.  But Molly's the one who fished with me. We both grew up really liking fishing and then she kind of went off and did a bunch of aquaculture and stuff like that. She just became a mom. So, now I'm an aunt, and she lives up in Cooper with her family. So, yeah, my family is pretty awesome. (laughter)


Q: [00:04:04] We have a question that's do you have any history of fishing in your family? It sounds like you have a sister who's done aquaculture, a dad who's fished for a long time, but does it go back before that at all?


A: [00:04:15] My family history is foggy. My mom was an only child, and there's not a whole lot of information about her dad's side of the family or anything like that, so I have really no idea over there. On her side, I'm eighth-generation-Mainer, but on my dad's side, I'm first. His family are all a bunch of lawyers and doctors and all that kind of thing. So, they never fished. But back in the history of his family, I know there was a boat captain, but our family doesn't really keep much records. (laughter) 


Q: [00:04:55] Do you know what got your dad into it? 


A: [00:04:58] Apparently, my dad is kind of like me. Just the second he was born, he's like, “I want to go fishing.” He grew up kind of close to the water. So he was just always hiking down to the beach, spear fishing, fishing, fishing, fishing, anytime he could possibly be fishing. I don't know. Apparently, according to him, that's all he ever wanted to do. That's all he ever thought about. It's pretty consistent. (laughter)


Q: [00:05:24] From what you walked us through, it sounds like, probably not, but just to ask the question, do you have any history of family working in other roles in the fishing industry, but not necessarily fishing, such as fish processing, marketing, bait, gear?


A: [00:05:39] Well, my little sister and I have both done different kinds of fishing. Because I got a commercial license young and have had my own boat for a long time, I haven't been able to jump on other opportunities and try things out, but I did work on a dragger boat when I was younger, and some stuff like that. But my sister Molly has worked on an oyster farm. I'm pretty sure she's worked on a seaweed farm. She’s sterned on a bunch of boats in all sorts of different harbors, but that's pretty much it. Yeah.


Q: [00:06:18] Is she out of the industry right now (inaudible)?


A: [00:06:22] Yeah. Right now, she's just full mom zone, so she's just taking a break. 


Q: [00:06:31] Could you tell me a little bit about your educational background? 


A: [00:06:35] Yeah. So, I went to high school here in Belfast, and I graduated in ’09, and then I went out to California for college. I went to Humboldt State University in Northern California, and I went there for a studio art degree because, basically, when I graduated, I already had a lobster boat and a commercial license. So, I was like, “Well, I'm done. I'm going to be a commercial lobster fisherman.” And my dad's like, “Yeah, no.” He's like, “You need a college degree.” So he's like, “I don't care what you do. When you're done with that, you can do whatever you want, but you need a backup plan.” I was super smart at seventeen and was like, “I'm going to California to get an art degree. See ya.” So, I did that, and I think I graduated in 2013, but I didn't end up leaving until 2014. When I was in college, I came home to fish every single summer and paid for school and everything that way. It was the one time I really had – art was my job, which was really cool, but all my art was the coast of Maine, lobster boats, lobsters. I missed it a lot. I wanted to come home. (laughter)


Q: [00:07:51] You stayed until 2014, and then you came back. You've been lobstering out of Rockport since then. 


A: [00:07:58] Yep. I've been lobstering out of Rockport. The second I got back from school, I was able to start fishing full-time, and that's been it.


Q: [00:08:08] And then, are you married? 


A: [00:08:10] No. 


Q: [00:08:11] And do you have any children? 


A: [00:08:12] Nope. 


Q: [00:08:13] If you had children in the future, would you be interested in them going into fishing or related marine industry? 


A: [00:08:20] Yeah. I hope to have kids in the future. That's one thing I struggle with, is like, I really hope that – I hope the industry is still around for me to share it with them. Because for me, growing up with my dad on the boat was the most amazing thing ever. I feel like I had such a good childhood. I don't know. I learned so much, and it just gave me so much joy. I really never played video games. I never did any of that stuff. I was always just like, “I want to be on the boat. I want to go do this, I want to go do that.” I just feel like I got so much out of it, and so much self-confidence in a way that helped me through high school, helped me through all the normal baloney. I definitely would want to share that with my kids, like bad. I really hope that they would be into it, but it is a little hard to imagine telling them to do exactly what I'm doing right now. Everything's changing a lot, and it's going to continue changing a lot. So, who knows? By the time they show up, and they're available to perhaps get a boat, do all that stuff, are we going to have an industry? Is there any money in it? Because you can love it as much as you want, but it costs a lot of money to do it, and it's really physically destroying and demanding, so it's kind of hard to weigh that out. At the same time, I'm a sucker for punishment, so I would never tell them not to if they wanted to, but I'd probably do the same thing my dad did. Even though I resented him at the time, I still think I'd be like, “All right, well, you need to have other skills, too.”


Q: [00:10:03] And then diving a little more kind of into your current businesses and your role, so you’re lobstering, and you have your restaurant. Could you say a little more? Expand on that, describing your current role and work in the fishing sector in Maine.


A: [00:10:17] Yeah. So, I just decided to go big (laughter), which is awesome, and I'm really proud of it, but at the same time, it comes with 800,000 difficult things. I got into lobstering when I was young, and when lobstering was awesome. And basically, whatever you put into it, you'd get out of it. I grew up watching all these guys come in with thousands of pounds of lobster and be able to take care of their families and be huge parts of the community and have these beautiful boats and traps and trucks and the whole thing. I just always was like, “I really want that.” But, as I got into it more, and being a young person, making a check, understanding that things cost money, all of that, I was able to kind of see how the industry is very complicated, and we don't have control over – we can only control going out, our equipment, and that kind of stuff. We cannot control the market. We cannot control what bait and fuel costs. All that stuff is really important. 


So, I started going to the farmers market and selling lobsters when I couldn't fish full-time because I started with a student license. So, you basically gain your trap limit every season. I started going to the farmers market because I just love lobsters, and I was like, “I'll just talk about lobsters all day, and this is another way I can do that.” People really enjoyed my product and encouraged me into lobster rolls. I then went into an indoor farmers market. People loved it. Then I went to a food truck. People really liked it, but the food truck was complicated because we did it through the pandemic. Anyway, that was just insanely complicated, but we survived, and then pretty much right after, I had the opportunity to go into a brick-and-mortar building. We decided that even with all the risks going on, we would just go for it because it's either going to work or it's not going to work. 


Basically, I wake up in the morning during the season, and I go to haul, and then I get off the boat and go straight to the restaurant, and then we do the restaurant and close. Then, I go home, and I pass out, and then I wake up the next day, and I do it again from about May until Thanksgiving. It's amazing. It’s really rewarding in a lot of ways. I love lobstering, and it makes me so happy. I love having the restaurant and feeding people what I catch. I'm super passionate about it, but it is just so complicated to make any of the numbers work. People love what we're doing, and I love fishing and all of it, but the whole world has changed. I'm thirty-two. I feel like I'm constantly having the rule book changed. (laughter) I’m like, “OK, we figured it out.” And then it's just like, whoosh, something totally different. So, it feels like Sisyphus rolling a rock uphill, but at the same time, I so believe in what we're doing. The community loves what we're doing. It's just confusing to know how to change things to make it work. Also, anywhere you live in Maine is basically rural, even if you're in a city. Belfast is growing, but still, the wintertime, things shut down. Lobstering for us – my harbor freezes over, so we stop fishing. I don't know. But it's also really fun to be able to be in control of your own stuff and be able to shift gears and try and evolve and adapt to everything. It's just endlessly entertaining but also endlessly confusing. (laughter)


Q: [00:14:14] It’s a lot. Can you take me through the different commercial fishing licenses you have, and then also maybe – it sounds like you started with a student license – where you started from and what you have now?


A: [00:14:26] So, in the state of Maine, when you're in school, you can get a student license, and that's the easiest way to get a lobster license. I got mine when I was seven or eight, and then I had three or four traps. Basically, you start with a couple traps, but it's changed a little bit because – I mean, when I was seven was a quite a long time ago now. Then, you could go all the way up to, I think, 150 traps with your student license, and you had to log two hundred hours on a boat. You had to have that signed off by the wardens and by the captain and all that stuff. But once you got to two hundred hours, it automatically turned into a commercial license. So, when I was fourteen, I got my commercial license. But when you get your commercial license, you can only have the 150 traps, and then each year, you can get another hundred tags. But if you don't buy the tags, then you're set back another year, if that makes sense. 


So, it took me quite a while, especially when I went to college and stuff, to get myself up to the eight hundred limit. But I got to that when I was twenty-eight, twenty-nine – something like that. That's pretty much it – student license and then commercial license, and a commercial license covers eight hundred traps, and that's the maximum that you can have. Basically, I ended up with my own boat because I was fishing off my dad's boat, so he had to give up – shave off some of the traps that he was fishing in order for me to pull traps. Then, the fact that I just kind of kept showing up and wanting more, he's like, “Oh my God, you need to get off my boat.” (laughter) That’s how that happened. Any vessel can do eight hundred traps, but that's it, even if it has two licensed captains on it. 


Q: [00:16:30] So, when did you get your own boat? 


A: [00:16:32] So, I got my first boat when I was fourteen. It was a nineteen-foot seaway with a little 88 Evinrude outboard on it. That thing was dangerous, but I fished that for a couple years. I named it the Miss Understood.


Q: [00:16:50] That’s good.


A: [00:16:51] I felt so good about that. I felt very clever. I fished that for a little while, but then it became clear that – I don't know. It was dangerous trying to fish because I wanted to fish more gear, and that boat – you could maybe fit five traps. If you had two people on it and five traps, the whole thing was basically sinking. Also, fishing with an outboard is difficult because there's rope everywhere. I was only fishing the shoreline in the harbor. Then, I think was seventeen, or maybe I just turned eighteen when my sister and I bought the boat I have now, which is a twenty-eight-foot Novi Ross Bros, and then I've got a three-foot trap rack on it. I love that boat so much. I'm definitely ready to move up, but the industry has been insane, so I invested in the restaurant instead. This boat is like a battle ax. I've had it for more than fifteen years. I fish eight hundred traps off of it, which is insane. The only hard part is putting them in in the beginning of the season, taking them out at the end and shifting gear. But other than that, it's no problem. (laughter)


Q: [00:18:03] And then do you have –? You have a state license. Do you fish only inshore? 


A: [00:18:07] Yes.


Q: [00:18:08] You don't have federal, offshore –? 


A: [00:18:08] So, I'm so far inshore that my territory basically stops right around – I overlap with Rockland, overlap with North Haven, overlap with Camden, but I can't go beyond that. I don't go offshore. My boat's not even remotely close to good enough for that. (laughter)


Q: [00:18:33] Are there any other species that you also target (inaudible) if they’re in your traps?


A: [00:18:42] Yeah. Well, I've spent most of my life halibut fishing in the spring, which I really, really enjoy, but that's just changed in a lot of ways, and it costs quite a bit of money to go do it, so I haven't gone the last few years because the market's been weird, and they keep cutting down the times – they keep making the season shorter. Where I like to go, it’s when I know there's no fish there, so it just sucks. (laughter)


Q: [00:19:12] So, you had a halibut license in the past, but you're not –?


A: [00:19:16] Yeah, I haven't. That's one thing I actually take advantage of. I really like to go with my dad because it's one thing where we can still fish together and do that, and it's just really fun. Yeah. It's just changed a little bit. I don’t know.


Q: [00:19:33] Any other species you've targeted in the past, or still do?


A: [00:19:35] Green crab. I go after green crabs right now. But they're just an invasive species, so you don’t – I think, basically if anyone sees them, kill them. The state is just like, “Kill all green crabs. We do not want them here.” So I catch those. I have a green crab trap. There's so many of them. It's insane. I use them at the restaurant in our seafood stock, and it's delicious. It's really, really delicious. But I only use three pounds in a stock, which makes a ton of chowders. I can catch three pounds of green crabs in one minute. Seriously. I can throw the green crab trap off the dock and pull it back up, and it's full of green crabs. It's insane. So, I've been trying to come up with different ways to use them. I've got some acreage in Searsmont, and I'm trying to make compost out of them. I’m trying to figure out how to make a market. I'm trying to give them away to people to see if they'll get a taste for it that I can then sell them because we still need to use bait to get them. But that's something that's been frustrating, but also exciting to be part of, because they're getting thicker and thicker and thicker up here, which is also affecting the lobster population and affecting the whole way the coast looks like, even clamming – everything. They’re eating everything, but they also reproduce faster than, I think, anything else in the Gulf of Maine, something like that. It's kind of scary. So, I don't know. It’s one of those things that's new and exciting to experiment with, but also, it's like, “I don't even understand how we're ever going to combat this.”


Q: [00:21:37] Have you seen their populations change over your lifetime growing up here? 


A: [00:21:40] Oh, yeah, I feel like in the last ten years, I went from having seen them when I'm on the beach as a kid, playing in the seaweed, to catching them in every trap I have in a cove. They would start out being the size of a half dollar. Now, they're the size of a small – I don't even know – Jonah crab. They’re huge. I'm catching them huge. Yeah. They're nuts. I've been working with this group called Greencrab.org. It's just so fascinating because they're really trying to get all these different restaurants to use them in all these different ways. I'm constantly looking, like, what are real chefs doing? I like fishing, and I like food, so that's how I got into it. I'm not a chef. I’ve never been trained for anything. I just know what tastes good. So, I read everything they're doing. I'm like, “OK, I want to try that.”


Q: [00:22:30] Yeah, I was just going to ask what got you into – I mean, obviously, you're seeing them, you're hauling them, but what got you interested in experimenting with them? Was that just something you did on your own? Or had you heard about Greencrab.org? How did it start for you?


A: [00:22:42] Honestly, I'm pretty sure I saw – I think the first time that it dawned on me that they were delicious – well, I started catching them, and I was like, “Where did these come from? What are they?” And most stuff in the ocean you can eat. So, I started thinking about it and Googling them. But then I went to the Maine Fishermen's Forum, and they had a table there, and Greencrab.org was there, and I bought a cookbook of theirs. I was speaking to them, and that's when I really was like, “OK, there's something here.” They explained to me that it's a delicacy in Spain and stuff like that. In my mind, I'm like, “I'd love to try mochi,” which is basically them soft, deep fried. Anyway, it gets your brain going into like, “Oh, what kind of traps do I need? Oh, what kind of thing?” What I'm trying to work on right now is making a – I don't even know – what do you call it? A cage but with all the little cubes in it. 


Q: [00:23:49] Little hotel (inaudible).


A: [00:23:50] Yeah, exactly. So, I took a trap apart, and I've been trying to build one at my house. I don't know. It's just interesting, and I love all that stuff.


Q: [00:24:01] Yeah. Right now, you're using them like hard shell for stock in your restaurant, and that’s the main preparation.


A: [00:24:07] Yeah. Because I can just get rid of a ton of them at once. I've sat down and picked a few of the big ones. But that is not – I cannot do that fast enough to make it make sense to sell anything at the restaurant. I made crab cakes out of it at home. They were teeny, tiny, little like crab cakes, but they were delicious. I feel like there's a start of something, but nobody's totally figured it out yet. (laughter)


Q: [00:24:38] How about the composting? How long have you been experimenting with that? 


A: [00:24:43] I started experimenting with that by doing the stock because I had all the stuff afterwards. I don't know. I like using everything. I just was like, “Oh, I don't want to throw this in the dumpster. It’s going to smell, and my landlord's going to be upset with that. I just started taking it home and putting it in a pile. I have a regular compost, and then I started a whole separate compost in the woods. I just started – I don't know. I think I've had it for a year now, and I just keep adding it and turning it around. The shells are all still whole. I've got lobster shells and stuff in it, too. When you go and buy soil, they've got the stuff that's like lobster soil. I put some seaweed in there. We'll see.


Q: [00:25:28] Have you used it yourself in any home gardening? 


A: [00:25:30] Not yet, because it's still not broken down enough. I need a tractor. (laughter) That would help a lot. It's just another experiment. I know some people have been doing it more because they've been more prolific in Rhode Island and up the coast, New Hampshire and all that. I've been trying to just look up people who already had been experimenting with those things and just seeing what they are doing. 


Q: [00:26:01] You said you got the idea from being at the Fisherman's Forum. What year do you think that was? During the pandemic? 


A: [00:26:11] Man, the pandemic made all time not seem real to me. It has to have been three or four years ago. Yeah, I'll say that. (laughter)


Q: [00:26:24] Are you part of Greencrab.org’s harvester network?


A: [00:26:28] I don't know. I've talked with them. They've interviewed me. Honestly, I work way too much to be really good at any of that stuff. Everyone's like, “Do you want to be part of this?” I'm like, “Great, as long as I don't have to do anything.” (laughter) Call me if you need something, and I will try to get back to you. 


Q: [00:26:52] Yeah, that makes sense. 


A: [00:26:55] I can be the worst.


Q: [00:26:57] (laughter) Then in terms of any and all species and fishing activity you have, we have some questions just to prompt – getting you to talk about your experience that might be other than the fishing or harvesting itself. Do you have experience in the pre-harvest activities, like bookkeeping, bait, gear preparation?


A: [00:27:14] I do all that for myself. So, yeah, it's a lot. (laughter)


Q: [00:27:27] Can you tell us –? Are you doing traps in the winter? Bait, I know, is a big topic.


A: [00:27:32] So, I bought property in 2019, and I've been working towards building my own infrastructure, but I haven't had that yet. I don't have a shop. I have to wait until the spring. I have a trap yard now, but I don't have a shop, so I have to wait until everything melts in the spring to start doing any gear work, which is a pain in the butt because you have all the downtime in the winter, and then, all of a sudden, things start to change, and it's just full-on go time. So, gear work just starts – literally, you wake up, and you're just like, “Can I pull those ropes out of this ice pile? I think I can. All right. I'm going to get those done today.” And then you go from there. The second it’s forty-five degrees up to fifty-something degrees, it’s like, “OK, I could paint something.” But yeah, I mean eight hundred traps. You have to touch every rope, every buoy, every trap. It's a lot of work. It is a lot of work. With the bookkeeping and stuff, honestly, it's way easier than restaurant. I feel lucky that I've had my – I started when I was really young, and so my dad helped guide me through a lot of it. I think the hardest part is the way that I fish; it's seasonal, and that's how most people fish around here. So, you really have to be good at managing your money in a way to get you through the winter, which is really difficult because also, as a fisherman, you're a gambler, so you're like, “Oh my God, I need a new engine. I'm just going to go for it, and assume that the lobster season is going to be awesome because why wouldn't I?” But then, that's why the last few years have been so crazy because you just have to keep investing in yourself. When things are showing – “OK, I've been tracking like this for the last few years. I know I can do this. I know I can do that.” But there's no safety net when it all goes the opposite direction. That's what's been happening in the last few years, is people really invested in themselves. They got the boat that made it less wear and tear on your body. They invested in the traps that fish better. They did this and that, and then it just – I don't know. Then people aren't being able to make payments. People aren't being able to do this and that. That's also why I stuck with my boat, which bothers me sometimes because I’ve way outgrown this thing, but at the same time, I own it. The bank doesn't own it. You have to really think about all that stuff way more than other people do. (laughter)


Q: [00:30:19] That’s a lot. Yeah. Can you tell me about any experience you have –? I think you already have mentioned some earlier, but if you want to say more about it in terms of post-harvest, processing, marketing, trade. I'm thinking you talked about even starting really young at farmers markets, doing your own direct marketing. 


A: [00:30:34] Yeah. Even before the farmers market, I used to be really – it’s funny, I haven't really thought about this, but I used to be really interested in trying to sell my lobsters directly to restaurants. I used to just hike around, being like, “Hi, my name is Sadie. I fish in Rockport. Do you want live lobsters for your restaurant? I can deliver them.” That was always cool. It got me into these restaurants that I just thought were really cool, but I always fished, so I never worked in a restaurant or anything. I always loved food. I’m like, “Well, my product’s high quality. If you're selling Maine lobster, and you’re in this area, you should be selling my Maine lobster.” So, that was cool. I did it with the halibut, too. That showed me that if I just put in extra effort, I could get paid a little bit more, work with really cool, talented people. Then, that led me to the farmers market, where I'm driving around. Delivering small batches of lobster was a lot of effort for not that much money. So, I'm like, well, what if I go to a farmer's market, and I bring my whole catch there, and then I can sell them to the people coming to the farmers market? 


That worked out pretty cool. It’s been exciting to be – when you're lobstering, you're just on the boat. You wake up before anyone else wakes up. You go to work, you're done, you're tired, you go home, and you go to sleep, generally, and you're just around your little community. By bringing the lobsters to the people, most of them have never even met a fisherman in their entire life. I realized that it was an opportunity for me to show people a different face of who's actually lobstering. I really, truly believe in eating food that's as close to the source as possible, knowing who harvested it, all that stuff because then you know that it's good practice. You know where your money's going. It stays local, all that stuff. I believe in all of that. It was really cool to get to start meeting people and talk to people who didn't know anything about lobsters; they've just eaten them. They had no idea how much effort it takes to go get one. They have no idea what investments it takes, how much skills you have to build up over time, how much wear and tear on your body it is. They had no clue. That's what snowballed into my Must Be Nice lobster restaurant. Even when I was able to fish full time, I still was like, “Well, I'll still do my Saturdays.” It was nice community, social time. Yeah. So, I just really enjoyed that.


Q: [00:33:25] Yeah. You started experimenting with direct marketing as a teenager, right? 


A: [00:33:28] Yeah.


Q: [00:33:29] Was your dad, at the time, selling all of his lobster to a dealer? Did you know people direct marketing?


A: [00:33:34] My dad was always basically selling directly to the dealer and me too. We catch so many lobsters that no one, no restaurant, nobody's going to take that many. I'm trying to think. No one’s really ever asked me this question. How did I even think about that? I guess just growing up in the industry, you know that there's always – you have to hustle a market sometimes. I've just been involved since I was so young. Honestly, maybe halibut fishing got me into it because halibut fishing, you have to make your own market. So, I'd go fishing on my dad's boat, but I was the one who would call the co-op, call the restaurants, call all the places around, and negotiate a price and all that stuff. I don't know. I was definitely a young teenager when I started just calling places. Also, I didn't really grow up with any friends doing what I was doing. Maybe that also made me feel like, well, I've got the best product, so I should be the one doing this. (laughter)


Q: [00:34:48] Sounds like you’re a natural marketer. 


A: [00:34:51] I guess so. (laughter)


Q: [00:34:52] Do you have any experience doing advocacy for the industry, or being involved with community-based organizations related to fisheries?


A: [00:35:02] Yeah. I've been part of the MLA [Maine Lobstermen's Association] pretty much my whole life. Growing up, I've always been fairly involved, but the last few years, there's been a lot of stuff against us, and we've been having a lot of issues. That definitely got me to – literally, I've pretty much done any interview anyone's asked me to do, no matter what, even though it's complicated in my time frame and this, that, and the other I've written to NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] probably a hundred times. I've done all the public commenting for everything I could figure out. I do a lot of that. I've gone to anything where the fishermen get together, which really doesn't happen very much. The MLA has had a few different meetings and things like that. I've gone to some stuff with the DMR [Department of Marine Resources], but it's hard. It’s really hard to – a lot of times, a lot of the things that happen that you're supposed to comment at happen when they know fishermen can't make it. That's been really difficult, especially because we're the whole coastline, and oftentimes, they'll do it in Portland or something. So, for me, that's two hours. Someone from way up north – they make it hard. (laughter)


Q: [00:36:38] Yeah, definitely. Do you have any experience in fisheries extension?


A: [00:36:43] What's that? 


Q: [00:36:44] Sea Grant, for example.


A: [00:36:47] Have I worked with Sea Grant? I don't know. Were they involved in the –? I don't think so. But I can't remember at this point. That's the other thing. I’ve done so many things, and I'm just like, “Sure, this sounds like a good idea,” and then, the next day, I'm like, “All right, I've got eight hundred other things.” 


Q: [00:37:12] Can’t keep it all –


A: [00:37:13] I'm horrible like that. (laughter)


Q: [00:37:14] It's OK. No worries. Not super important. Do you have any experience participating in any research and development related to the industry? 


A: [00:37:24] Not particularly. I've talked with the DMR a few times about some of the projects they've been doing, but I wouldn't say I've ever been insanely helpful just because of the scale of what I'm doing. I've tried, and I know a lot of people do. Yeah. (laughter)


Q: [00:37:46] Any background in the hatchery side of (inaudible) –


A: [00:37:50] No, none of that. 


Q: [00:37:51] – aquaculture?


A: [00:37:52] None of that. 


Q: [00:37:53] And then we have food service, food preparation, customer interface. Yes.


A: [00:37:57] Yes. I excel at that. (laughter)


Q: [00:38:01] Remind me, how long did you say your restaurant’s been open?


A: [00:38:04] This is our second full season open in the space that we're in at the restaurant. Now, I get all my lobster processed for me because, oh my god, when I started, we picked all the lobster ourselves. I just had a flashback. It was basically you'd get off the boat with a hundred pounds of lobster and go straight to the commercial kitchen and cook the lobster and then pick it out. I'd get home at eleven o'clock at night and then get up for the farmers market the next morning at six, and that was just insane. 


Q: [00:38:43] Too much.


A: [00:38:44] But we did it. We did it. (laughter)


Q: [00:38:46] I’m curious because I know we've lost a lot of our processing infrastructure; where do you get your meat picked?


A: [00:38:52] There's a few different processors still in the state, but I go through Greenhead.


Q: [00:39:00] Cool.  And if you can, which you might have to pick a few different times of year, talk – you've been doing it a little bit throughout the interview, but could you tell us what an average day of work looks like for you, and that could be in the on season versus –


A: [00:39:13] Yeah. The one thing about my life is that every month, it totally changes. In general, an average day of work for me is I get up before sunrise, and then I get down to the harbor. I get my boat, and I get my bait, and I get my crew, and then I go out and haul. The thing is, you can start hauling at first light. So, it changes dramatically from when you can start working early in the season to – right now, it’s not until six, 6:30 until it starts getting light. But early on, it's like 3:30, four o'clock, which is awesome. I start around then, and then I go and pull traps. It takes about eight hours. I come back in, put the boat on – sell my lobsters. Then I go and get my crew off the boat, wash the boat down, put the boat on the hook, come back in, grab my check and my slip, and then go to the restaurant. That's always a whole bag of monkeys, whether they need me to step in and work front-of-house or hop in the kitchen or get them something that we ran out of, or talk to customers, or something like that. I end up being there until – in the summer, we close at seven. I'll get home at nine or ten, depending on how that went. (laughter) Then, usually, lately, I've been just eating dinner at the restaurant. I get home, and I pass out, and I wake up in the morning. (laughter) Yeah. But it's nice. I don't really feel – in the winter, my whole life just stops. The restaurant – we shut down around Thanksgiving, Lobstering, I now shut down around Thanksgiving. I used to fish into January, but it just hasn't been super worth it for me. Also, I have a lot of physical issues from fishing, so I'm trying to be a little smarter as I get older. (laughter) I just take a break. The last ten years, I've been going to the Bahamas in the winter, so that's been awesome. 


Q: [00:41:31] Nice. Because you have a sister down there, right?


A: [00:41:33] Yes. That’s where my big sister lives. Actually, it's where my ex-boyfriend's from. So, I know everybody. It’s nice. You go down. It’s family. It doesn’t feel like a real vacation. It feels like, OK, I'm going to my other home. It’s also the only way for me to stop working all the time is to be in a different country (laughter) because otherwise, you look out, and you're like, “Oh man, I got to do this. Oh, I got to do that. Oh my gosh. I should just go in and do this one thing that turns into eight hundred things.” You can't stop, especially when you're your own boss. It's like, well, if you don't do it, no one's going to do it. And then you just keep going like that. (laughter)


Q: [00:42:18] Yeah. Wow. Could you tell me a little bit about how you feel that your background or identity sort of shapes your work in the fishing industry, including how others perceive or treat you?


A: [00:42:30] I feel like that one kind of tough. I grew up definitely feeling like I could do anything and that me being a girl didn't really matter. But as I've gotten older, I have felt like that's not so much the case. (laughter) But I also think that, in a lot of ways, I've had to work a lot harder than other people to have, like, any respect or anything at all in the industry, which is a pain in a lot of ways, but also a good thing. And that's why I am such a hard worker, and I'm really stubborn, and I don't really know when to back down all that stuff, which is a good thing when you're wanting to run a business. Things are always complicated. Things are always hard. You have to be adaptable, and you have to be able to be tough and not take things that people say personally and all that stuff. But it's also hard. I don't know. When you think that this whole community is like community, and then you realize that you've known them for thirty-plus years, and when it comes down to it, you're still the person that nobody cares about. (laughter) I don't know. It can be really lonely, but at the same time, there's nothing I'd rather be doing. I don't know. There’s a weird thing about it, where, really, when it comes down to it, you're the one that everyone's just like, “Whatever.”


Q: [00:44:16] Does it make a difference being a woman in the industry, having grown up here on the coast, and being from a fishing family? Do you feel like that shapes experience too?


A: [00:44:29] I think that in Maine, it makes a huge difference if you have the same last name as a million other people because then you have a whole gang of people that are – they're just always together, even if there’s big drama. But I don't really know. I've only had my experience. (laughter)


Q: [00:44:55] I don't know if you have any of these, but how does your role in the fishing sector work with any sort of family or caregiving responsibilities that you may have, including future plans for them, if relevant?


A: [00:45:11] I find it very complicated. It's hard for me to imagine how it works, which is partially why I don't have any kids yet because I have struggled wrapping my head around how I make all that work. But I have some really awesome women friends in the industry who basically when I've talked to them about it, specifically this one woman who is just – she's such a badass. I remember talking to her about it, and I’m like, “I want to have a family. I want to do these things. How does this work?” And she's like, “Well, you're the boss. You can do whatever the hell you want.” (laughter) She's like, “You can show up to work when you need to. You don't have to show up at four o'clock in the morning.” But also part of the industry is proving yourself and being on the same – blah, blah, blah. But as a woman and having more obligations than most of these guys do, it's hard to see the judgments, but it's also like, that's totally right. This is my job. This is my business. This is my boat. If I want to show up at ten because my kid needs to do whatever, but I still want to go haul, I'm going to do it. I don’t know. Just being able to talk to some women who've made it happen has made me feel better about it and more confident about it. My mom hasn't been a huge part of my life. So, I don't really have a lot of female influences to help me think about that. I've just more had the male influence of “Get up and go. You can't take time off. You can't do this. You can't do that.” So, that’s been a little bit conflicting. I don’t know. I think it's exciting. (laughter)


Q: [00:47:08] Thanks. So, shifting gears a little bit to any observations you have about how the marine environment has changed, can you describe any changes in the marine environment that you've noticed in your time on the water?


A: [00:47:21] Well, everything they said that was going to happen when I was in elementary school is happening. Surprise, surprise. The ocean's getting way warmer. Everything's different. Nothing is the same as it was when I was a kid. For one, lobsters are moving north towards Canada because the water is getting warmer, and all the animals are changing. I'm seeing tuna fish in the bay. I never saw that as a kid ever. Also, all the codfish and striper and all these other fish are coming back, which are like eating lobsters, and all of that stuff is causing the lobster population to go down. I find it all confusing because I swear it's exactly what they said was going to happen when I was in third – all my life in school. But now it's a contested thing. “Well, it's overfishing.” No, it's not because we knew this was going to happen. We have all these regulations – we have had the most regulations of anyone catching lobsters. We throw back way more than we keep. You told us they were moving north to Canada. Canada's having the biggest record harvest that they've ever had in all of time. But now you want to tell us that we're overfishing all of a sudden? Give me a break. Everything's changed. We see it every single day. People are catching seahorses once in a while in their traps. Someone caught an ocean tally, which I see in the Bahamas. It’s wild. Things have changed just exponentially. I can't even keep up. (laughter)


Q: [00:49:03] Yeah, wow. So I'm hearing you say obviously warming water, shift in the lobster population latitude, also different species showing up.


A: [00:49:14] Predators. So many more predators. All of a sudden, we have more sharks than we've had in years. That's because we're having more bait than we've had in years, which means we've had more seals than we've had in years, which means sharks have more food than they've had in years. It's all connected, and the warming water is also causing a lot of different weird things that you're seeing more down south. But it’s coming up this way, like algae blooms and things like that that take all the oxygen out of the water and then cause these big mass deaths. I don't know. It just seems like all these things are happening faster and faster than they ever did. I mean, all the old timers are everything happens in the seven-year cycle, which, on one hand, seems totally true. You look back, and that makes a lot of sense, but now everything's happening. There's the natural seven-year cycle, but then like this whole other tornado going on at the same time. I don't know. The best thing my dad ever said was, “The more he fishes, the less he knows.” I swear to you, that's it. You can go lobstering and take all the traditional things – “Oh, when the lilac blooms, there'll be shedders” – blah, blah. None of it's true anymore at all. 


Q: [00:50:34] The shedding, the time of year of that is different now, too?


A: [00:50:36] Oh, yeah. It's all water temperature dependent. Fall used to be the time when we would be just rolling in lobsters. That hasn't happened in a while. I know it's different because our territory is super strict, so offshore has been doing better than inshore. But a lot of that is because the deeper water keeps temperature more consistent. Lobsters just are really sensitive to that. It's also changing their molting pattern and their dropping their eggs pattern. But we just keep going and try and like – it's like, “Well, last year, this kind of seemed to work, so we'll try that. Oh, no. OK.” But other things – last year, we had a ton of rain. It rained and rained and rained and rained and rained. The freshwater had a huge impact on everything going on in the ocean, too. But also, we have crabs like we've never had. I'm catching more crabs in my traps than anything sometimes it seems like, and they're getting huge. That all competes with lobsters for territory. That all competes with – they're all fighting each other for food. It's insane. (laughter)


Q: [00:51:52] There are many different changes, so this a big question, which is how do those changes you just described impact your work with your lobster business and the restaurant?


A: [00:52:03] Well, us catching a lot less lobsters is not good because it still costs us. It costs us more now to go out and catch them just because of the way everything has gone, and we're getting paid less to do it. I don't know. We have so much up against us. We keep being expected to reinvest in all of our gear over and over and over again. No one's paying for that except us. We're not making any money. That all just trickles out to the entire communities. Lobstering has been a huge part of the economy. That has really kind of turned off. Lobster fishermen are not spending money like they used to. We all used to have a great shedder season, go out and buy a new truck at the local place. We used to go take our family out to dinner, donate to the school hockey fund, and this, that, and the other. Now, a lot of fishermen – there's still some doing really well, but it's not the norm. People are just kind of like, “Ugh, I want to, but I can't.” People are losing their boats and losing their houses and losing – it's part of it, but I don't know. It's just terrifying. (laughter)


Q: [00:53:26] Is there anything you've tried as a business owner, both on your boat or in your restaurant, to cope with or adapt to some of those changes you described?


A: [00:53:34] My whole restaurant has been pretty much for me to attempt to adapt to all the changes because, for me, to sell the lobster to myself cuts out the middleman, which means I'm able to sell it for a higher profit. But that being said, it hasn't really worked out yet because I also had to invest in the restaurant, the infrastructure, and the whole thing. The long-term goal is that eventually, I'll have all that going, and I'll be able to basically benefit off of my fishing reputation regardless of what happens in that industry and still be able to use the restaurant to, perhaps, keep my boat and make something off of lobsters. I don't know, but it's confusing. I really hope things turn around in the industry, and this is just – we're just going through a hard time, and it all bounces back, but it's kind of hard to see that happening, especially with the way that everyone – the people who are in charge – are thinking about solutions because the solutions really seem to be against us for the most part. But with the restaurant, I'm really hoping I can at least – even if the catch goes down so far, people are still going to be eating lobsters. They're still coming to Maine for that. They still want that. But I have been considering – I don't know – doing all the things, like boat tours and more catering. I'm constantly trying to come up with something else.


Q: [00:55:15] Other sort of options to diversify income.


A: [00:55:17] Absolutely, and just use whatever I can that we are catching because the thing is, the tourist side of it, even though, growing up as a purist fisherman, it's hard for me to accept that at this point, but the tourists still all want it, and that's where the money's at. My boat’s my sanctuary. I don't want other – I don't want people out there. I don't want to explain everything I'm doing. I just want to do it. I'm just enjoying it. I'm out here to make money. You have to have a certain pace. It’s awesome. But then you take other people out, and it's cool. It's nice to share it, but it really gets – it's just kind of like, “Yep, this is a lobster, and this is how you band a lobster. All right. Now, here's a lighthouse, and there's a seal.” It’s cool, and people really enjoy it. I feel like being at the restaurant and dealing with people all the time, which I am passionate about, but the only way I feel like I have the battery power to do that is if I get to be actually lobstering on the boat. (laughter)


Q: [00:56:24] Yeah. So, if you had to change that, where your boat was now a tourist experience, it would be hard for you, or it’d be (inaudible) change?


A: [00:56:29] It's hard for me to wrap my head around. But I think also just having as many backup plans as possible is the only thing you can really do at this point.


Q: [00:56:40] In terms of, kind of getting the whole restaurant off the ground as part of  – you described as a response to all these uncertainties, what made that possible for you? It's a big deal to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant. Did you have any kind of resources, relationships, knowledge, training, organizations that you drew on to make that happen? How would you describe what made that possible? 


A: [00:57:06] I did all of that in probably not the smartest way. I just did it all myself. Lobstering was pretty good. I basically took all my profit from lobstering and invested in all of this. That gave me a cushion for quite a few years of being like, “OK, I can gamble with this.” I know I'll still make just enough money to survive with lobstering. I made more than that, so I was able to know that I'd have enough money to survive while also being able to gamble. Now that I'm a little older and I know people who are in the industry, most people don't do that. They get grants and funding and all this stuff. I also didn't really ever know anyone doing anything that I was doing, so I never really had any guidance on that. It’s also nice. I'm full owner of all my own stuff. Whatever decisions I make are the decisions, whether they be right or wrong. I just started trying to get more connected into some of those things. What was it? I took the Top Gun course last winter, I think it was, or the winter before last, through the Maine Center for Entrepreneurs. That was really awesome. That linked me up with a ton of really smart, talented people. I think the other thing is being in a small town in a rural space and working all the time, your network is kind of what is around you. Sometimes, you need more than that. You need someone from Portland who's doing it in the city and can give you advice because a lot of the businesses around here are just generationally owned, whereas I started from scratch. But as I get older, and as I keep doing it, I keep meeting more people and getting good mentors and stuff like that. But it's just been a – I was just like, “Yeah, sure, if anyone else can do it, why can't I do it?” (laughter)


Q: [00:59:21] And then have you been able to try everything you would want to, to be able to adapt to all the changes you described? Or, on the flip side, are there experiments or adaptations you'd like to try but haven't been able to? 


A: [00:59:33] Yeah. No, there's definitely quite a few things I would like to try, one of them being – I started attempting to get a mini cart so that I could do catering and fairs and stuff like that. But that was a whole mess. I basically have to tear – I tore the whole thing down, and we're rebuilding it from scratch. That's a future plan. But I think something like that is a really good idea. There's events everywhere all around all summer, and rather than sitting and waiting for people to come find you, you go find them. Then that's more advertisement for the restaurant. It's something I could do basically on my own or with one other person. The other thing is maybe doing one or two boat tours a week or month or something like that. Just having that option, I think, makes a lot of sense because also, on top of everything, that is another way to take people out to do something they wanted to do on their vacation, promote my restaurant – it all kind of goes together. So, I'm trying to think of more multi-level marketing schemes, I guess.


Q: [01:00:50] Yeah, or they reinforce each other.


A: [01:00:52] Yeah, things that can make stuff I've already really worked hard and invested in function. But the other thing around here that's really difficult is finding employees. I went big with the restaurant, and now I'm attempting to figure out a way to keep everything that we have going going, but at the same time, not need more people to do more. It's confusing. But every restaurant around here right now, the second kids go back to school, nobody has employees. (laughter) I don't see that changing anytime soon. So, that's also an interesting part of it. It's also odd because things – I have gotten some mentors who are way older than me, and I've had really successful businesses in the past, but things have changed so much, so a lot of the things that worked for them just don't work in this day and age. It’s, on one hand, terrifying, but on the other hand, it's exciting. It's like, “OK, well, nobody really knows the answer. Let's try this. Let's try that. This could work.”


Q: [01:02:05] Yeah, wow. Could you describe – what do you feel like is your biggest concern about the marine environment for the future of Maine's fisheries?


A: [01:02:19] My main concern, I guess, is that – I don't know. I've got a few concerns, and they're not super popular opinions. I'm severely anti-industrializing the ocean in any way. It makes no sense to me as to how that makes anything better at all in the world, period. I have heard nothing, read nothing that makes that make sense to me, especially in the sense of caring about the stuff in the ocean. The more we drill the ocean, the more we do sonar blasting, the more we bomb the ocean, all this stuff, it all affects the animals. They know that when it comes to fishermen, but then it's totally fine for them to want to put these like huge wind farms in, all the fish farms, all these things. And then the argument is green energy or needing to feed people. People who are starving are not eating salmon. Green energy? There's a million things we can be doing on land with land that's already developed and already whatever. It makes no sense to me. That terrifies me. You can see the impacts of a lot of those things while you're out there. I have a friend over in Rhode Island, and you talk to them, and the wind farms have absolutely affected that whole part of the ocean. Part of what we like is going out there and then leaving. It’s like, yeah, I've got a trap in the water, but I don't anchor my boat and live there for all of time. All the animals and everything still get to use it. It's all happening. It's natural and normal. Nature will figure itself out if we just leave it alone, in my opinion. I don't know. That just terrifies me because the more we think that we have the answers, the more we've destroyed the environment everywhere on this whole entire planet. 


So, no one can ever convince me that that's the answer to anything. I also believe that – why don't we talk about using less ever? It makes no sense. I think the only way to have an ocean or to have any environment left, which is the thing that's the most valuable thing to me in the entire world and that future generations deserve to have is to just leave it alone a little bit more. Let it be nature. Let the animals do what they're doing. They don't see lines and borders the way that we do. They move when the water gets too hot. Different things start growing here, different things start growing there. Mother Nature has a plan, and I just feel like we keep messing with it, and it's terrifying. You just keep seeing all the consequences on the news all the time. Florida constantly having big death scenarios in the in the water. It's terrifying. If we have no environment left, then what's the point? I don't know. (laughter)


Q: [01:05:28] And then, the flip side of that, if you could tell policymakers in Maine what the biggest priorities should be to help people adapt to or maybe prevent some of what you're describing, like stop it rather than adapt to it, what would you tell them what they should be prioritizing?


A: [01:05:46] I think prioritizing the people who live in Maine and the voices of the people who live in Maine would be awesome, and not prioritizing the big companies coming in and trying to profit off of us. I think one of the things about being a Mainer that's pretty through and through most of us is we like the way things are. We're simple people. I don't need a Tesla car. I don't need 5,000% more electricity. Let me live on the coast. I'll walk to my boat, but we can't do that. It's confusing. I think I'm just way more of a minimalist in the sense of those things. It feels like the state doesn't really listen to us anymore, and that's frustrating. I know my whole community feels that way because we went from being like the star child of us coming up with solutions and us doing this and us doing that to being told that we don't know what we're talking about, we're wrong, this, that, and the other. We need to be open to innovation. We need to be open to this, but it all comes with a price tag that no one else is paying for. Also, how is it better –? I don't know. I think my brain just does not function like other people's because it's like, OK, we all have these things that we already have. How is it better for the world and the environment to force us to buy more stuff? What are we doing with all this stuff that already exists? Just putting it in a landfill? It's all being used. It's all functioning. It's all fine. That stuff makes no sense to me. Also, they know we're not making money. So, it’s like, if you don't want us here, just be honest about it. It just is confusing. I don't know. All of us want things to function. We all are invested here. Most people have lived here for a hundred generations or something. I don’t know. (laughter)


Q: [01:07:51] Have you participated or had the chance to participate in any climate resilience or adaptation training programs for the fishing industry?


A: [01:08:00] No, I haven't even heard of those.


Q: [01:08:02] Neither has anyone else we’ve interviewed.


A: [01:08:04] It’s interesting. (laughter)


Q: [01:08:06] But we like to ask, and then if anything comes to mind, what strategies do you think would be effective in helping people in the fishing industry build resilience to the climate-related changes that people are experiencing? If training were to exist, what kinds of things would people benefit from?


A: [01:08:26] Honestly, I don't really know. The thing is, for us, I think quite a few years ago, everyone would have been very open to yeah, things are changing. How can we adapt? What are we going to do with more hurricanes coming up through here? And how do we make the working waterfront more, I don't know, resilient to all of that stuff and the storms and blah, blah, blah?  Keep our infrastructure functioning, things like that. At this point, I think it's a lot more of – are we going to exist in two years? So it's hard to be like, yeah, as the climate's changing, how do we adapt to that? It's one thing when you know that you're going to be around, and it feels a lot different when it's like, well, I'm just trying to get to next season. I'm just trying to make sure my kid can go to school. I'm just trying to pay off my college debt. I think that that's one thing. I think maybe the state just really needs to come up with a way to let us know that they want us around still, then people would feel like, OK, well, let's move forward with solutions and try to figure this stuff out or let us know that those things exist, programs to – whatever. I don't know. It's incredibly confusing because I don't think anyone would deny all these – we're watching it happen right in front of our eyes, but no one's changing what's causing any of it. So, why should we change? Why do we have to change everything we're doing and adapt to something that is clearly being caused by other things? But nothing has to change on that end. It's confusing, and it feels like we have the least resources to do anything about it. (laughter)


Q: [01:10:44] We've been asking about a lot of different kinds of changes, but are there any other types of changes which might not be environmental, that you haven't told us about, that you feel like are impacting your work that you want to share? You talked a little bit about being hard to hire people. That’s a kind of change that –


A: [01:11:01] Yeah. Crew is insanely difficult, but it's hard. Lobstering is so much work, and unless you know you're going to get paid really well, a normal person would never do it, ever. You have to be nuts to love it, even when you're not making any money. Because the wear and tear is insane. I'm thirty-two, and I have multiple exploded discs in my back. I have severe arthritis in my sacrum. I have shoulder issues, wrist issues, all of the things (laughter), which is just normal, natural for long-term physical labor. Younger people are looking at us and being like, “Why would I do that? Why would I work that hard? Why would I do that for nothing?” There was something else that I was thinking. Can you say the question one more time?


Q: [01:12:03] Sure. Are there other types of changes that don't have to be environmental necessarily that are impacting your work you want to tell us about? 


A: [01:12:11] So, the other one that I thought of is there's definitely some weird stuff going on with the price of lobster, and one thing that's happening – we don't have very many processing plants or anything in the state anymore, so we don't really have control over our industry like we used to have. So we're controlled by big seafood buyers. A lot of stuff that's been happening the last few years is out-of-state buyers have been coming in and inflating the price artificially to the point where – because they are the heavy hitters, they can do that, but the local, small-time buyers, who have been holding on, can't compete with them. So, fishermen are in a pickle; we need to make more money. If this buyer over here is paying us X, and this buyer over here is paying fifty cents more, a lot of times, boats will just go over to the other buyer, and that ends up putting the local buyers out of business and then they actually have stake in our communities and actually have a reason to want to see us succeed and be here, whereas, somebody in Chicago sitting behind a desk who's just like, “OK, well, we can afford to do this, and let's see how many boats we can attract and get rid of this buyer.” It's happened multiple times where they inflate the price, and then they bottom it out. So, that is really concerning to me, and that's also a huge reason I did the restaurant, because there's nothing we can do about any of that. All we can do is just have solidarity with our local buyers and hope that that's enough. That part's really confusing, and that's definitely something that I'm like, Huh? If it gets to the point where we have no local buyers, then I have no idea what that means for the future of the industry because, unfortunately, we have to make money. (laughter)


Q: [01:14:12] That’s really interesting. Nobody's told us. We haven't heard that exact story yet.


A: [01:14:16] It's been weird the last few years.


Q: [01:14:20] You said one response to that was you opening your own restaurant to not have to be reliant on the buyer. Yeah. Is there anything else that comes to mind in terms of responding to that?


A: [01:14:32] That's my only – I don't know. It's confusing. It’s just confusing because the thing is, we really rely on our buyers and generally have close relationships with them because we buy our bait and fuel and everything through them, and then they are committed to buying all of our lobsters. I don't know. There’s not a whole lot we can do. Lobster fishermen aren't really allowed to all get together and come up with a plan unless you have a co-op or something like that, and not everywhere has a co-op. A lot of places don't have enough fishermen to really have a co-op, things like that. It’s hard for me to see what other solutions there are out there if that stuff happens because also, we're each our own small business. So, there's only so much – and, what, there's 5,000 of us now? That’s not very many. We don't have all that much fighting power. I mean, if they'd come fight us to our faces, maybe. But that's never going to happen. (laughter)


Q: [01:15:53] Yeah. Then, maybe gears a little bit. Can you tell us about any opportunities or positive changes that you've noticed in the industry in your time?


A: [01:16:02] Yeah. So one thing that I've noticed in my time lobstering that's made me really, really happy is when I was a little kid, the only time anyone wanted to talk to me about fishing, all they wanted to talk to me was about the fact that I was a girl, and that used to bother me a lot because I've always just been like, “I'm a fisherman,” and I've wanted people to want to talk to me because I'm good at fishing, because I'm good at my business, and I'm good at what I do and used to really drive me nuts. It's like every person was like, “You're a girl. What's it like being a girl? What's it like being a girl?” Granted, that gave me a lot of publicity and has really helped me build my reputation for my restaurant. But deep down, as a fisherman, it's always been like, ugh. But there's multiple young girls right now that are lobstering, and there's a lot more women in the industry than I grew up knowing about and seeing and actually seeing in things and having any representation of. I was recently reading an article about one of the young girls in my harbor, and the whole article talked about her getting her grandfather's boat. Didn't once talk about how she's a girl fisherman and what's it like being a girl fisherman? It was just that she's a fisherman. She loves it. She worked hard enough to buy her grandpa's boat. I just literally was like, “This is amazing.” That made me so happy. 


So, there's definitely a lot more representation, and I think, a lot more opportunity for diversity in the industry. Oftentimes, people don't try things that they don't see someone like them doing. I think just the fact that that's way more prominent means that people – there are a lot of hardships about the industry, but it's so rewarding, and it's the best office you could ever have. I don't know. I never feel better than coming in from a long day hauling and feeling accomplished and getting a check for the work you just did – there's something so satisfying about it. The fact that other people, if you want to do it, know that they can do it is awesome. I think that that might be the best thing for the future of the industry, is just getting more diversity of thought and opinions and ideas on how we can move forward in a way because it's always been the same people making all the decisions. So, I don't know, more seats at the table. Maybe we'll figure it out. (laughter)


Q: [01:18:34] Maybe building on that, what is your hopeful vision for the future of Maine's coastal fisheries?


A: [01:18:39] I hope Maine continues to have a robust and thriving coastal fishery. I think the working waterfront is – in so many ways, it's the huge economy of Maine, but it's also the heart and soul of Maine. It's what people think of when they think of the state of Maine. It drives a ton of the tourism. It gives a lot of incredible jobs for people. It gives people a lot of agency in their own lives and flexibility. I just really hope that we can continue regarding that as a very important staple of what this state is and just support people to keep doing it. I think all the aquaculture happening is amazing. I think the way that restaurants, especially high-end restaurants, have really been going out of their way to highlight different aspects of the up-and-coming things that have been going on in the ocean is amazing. I don't know. It's just exciting because that also catches fire inside of people. Someone who's never had an oyster before, and then all of a sudden they realize there’s five oyster farms between here and here, and now they have to go to every single one of them and meet the owner and see how they do it. I don’t know. That's exciting, and I really hope that lobster can stay on that. But lobster might have to become something like all these other things, where it's even more expensive than it is now, and it's more of a delicacy than it is now, which means it's going to take a lot of promotion, but it's doable. I think people adapting to what's going on is going to be the most important thing, but I feel like we, as Mainers, want that, and feel that, and need that, and we're going to work towards it. 


Q: [01:20:28] Great. Thank you so much. Is there anything else you wanted to share with us that we haven't asked you about? 


A: [01:20:36] I don’t know. (laughter)


Q: [01:20:39] You can think on it for a second. Do you have any follow-up questions or anything we didn’t ask about, Jess?


F: [01:20:42] Yeah. I was wondering – you mentioned a little bit about the frequency of storms and waterfront access. How'd you guys make out in the January storms? 


A: [01:20:51] So, I did great. I was in the Bahamas (laughter), and my boat was out of the water. Rockport got hammered, but nothing like anywhere else. I was recently out on Vinalhaven, and you can see foundations of the old buildings that have been there for forever, hundreds of years. But one thing that I thought was interesting – Rockport signed up for the Disaster Relief Fund, and everywhere, got some money. But the thing that kind of struck me about it is, apparently, they basically had to build it back to what it was, and they weren't given the funds to build it up more resiliently, which I find weird because we know that this is going to happen more and more and more. So, in my mind, it's kind of like, isn't it going to cost more to do this twenty-seven times than it would be to come up with a strategy? I don’t know. Because we know it's going to happen. We're watching it everywhere. I mean, right now, there's three hurricanes in the Atlantic in October. That has never happened. Every year, it's just getting worse. So, that concerns me a lot. I just think the coastal communities are going to just be continually beaten up. I don't know. I don't know what we do about it. I'm just glad I live on a hill. (laughter)


Q: [01:22:27] I guess I thought of another one. We're really interested in green crabs and what people are trying to do with green crabs. We haven't spoken anybody who's using them in their own restaurant. What's been the reception from customers? Are you telling them a little bit about the story of green crabs?


A: [01:22:46] Yeah.


Q: [01:22:47] Or is it just like, “It's a crab bisque?”


A: [01:22:50] I have been trying to tell everybody about it. Honestly, I'm not the best at that because I’m spending a lot of time doing the physical labor part, but we have been getting more into being better at marketing and advertising, like, “Hey, these are an invasive species. This is what we're doing.” But the thing that I love the most is when I'm in there, someone orders – they don't read the description underneath it, which tells you all about it, but they just read “lobster chowder.” They're like, “All right, I want that.” They'll come up ten, fifteen minutes later. They're like, “That is the best chowder I've ever had. What is in it? What is the secret ingredient?” And I'm like, “Green crabs, the invasive species.” But I swear it gives it this velvety, softer – they're a real fatty kind of crab. I don't know. It just takes it to the next level, and people love it. Whether they're interested in the environmental impact of the green crabs, and that is what gets them to try it, or they try it, and they're just like, “This is so good,” and then they learn that. Also, I feel like food is a really good way to educate people. It's exciting for me to be able to, A, talk about the lobstering industry, but B, be like, “Hey, this is what's happening in the waters right now. Your diet could help change things. If you eat these, you are doing something good.” People feel good about that, so I'm trying to push that. 


Q: [01:24:32] Yeah. Do you think that there's potential for green crab – for the markets to develop – if there was more support and development of the market for it to help with diversifying Maine’s fisheries?


A: [01:24:45] I definitely do. I think green crab is definitely something that could help with diversifying Maine's fisheries. The thing is that they're affecting everything. They're even affecting the oyster farms, the mussel farms – everything. And they’re here. So, it would behoove Maine to get it together, put some funding together, create some sort of market or something for them. One thing I've been considering, but I don't have any experience in – I've been trying to talk to a couple of people. My seafood stock is the bomb. It's the best. I could use way more green crabs if I was just bottling the stock and selling that. But there’s a whole lot that goes into figuring that out. But at the same time, that would be a huge – you could go through so many green crabs if you pump the stock out, push it nationwide, something like that. We have to come up with something big. It's got to be big because there's so many of them out there. Unfortunately, again, people need to make enough money to make it worth it to go get them because you do need bait to catch them, whether it be – I mean, it could be literally anything; they'll eat anything. They're disgusting, but they're delicious. I don't know. It's like a lobster. I think there's huge opportunity there. The fact that you can – I've just been reading that you can use them in compost, which is why I've tried to do that. But they are full of tons of nutrients. They're full of delicious fatty crab essence, (laughter) and then they've also got a lot of meat in them. With lobsters, they're starting to pick them with a pneumatic chamber kind of thing I was reading about. Really weird. But I'm like, what if we tried to put a green crab in there? Would you not have to pick it by hand? Could you just get the meat out that way? Would that be a way to make it –?  Because you got to figure out how to make it more commercial, to combat them at all, and to make it make sense. But people are doing stuff like that. That guy – is he in Rhode Island, or is he in New Hampshire? – is making whiskey out of them?


Q: [01:26:56] It's New Hampshire. 


A: [01:26:58] Yeah. That’s so smart and so weird and so cool and just so niche. I feel like people are like, “Hmm, I got to try that one.” And it’s such a good idea. I really hope – I don't know. I hope we can figure something out, and I hope I'm part of it (laughter) because it is exciting. Also, when you hate them so much, it gives you drive to just keep going, be like, “All right. I need to figure out how to get rid of fifty bushel of you at a time.” (laughter)


Q: [01:27:26] Any follow-ups on that that you want to ask right now? 


F: [01:27:28] No, that’s awesome. 


Q: [01:27:29] Maybe that’s a good note to end on then. Awesome.
